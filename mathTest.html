<h1>Cash Credit with Private Money</h1>

<h5>Setup:</h5>
<p><b>
	Consider a cash credit goods economy in which households have preferences of the form \(\sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t (\log c_{1t}+\phi \log c_{2t})\), where \(c_{1t}\) and \(c_{2t}\) denote consumption of cash and credit goods, respectively, \(\phi\)  is a parameter, and \(0 < \beta < 1 \) is the discount factor.
	Households supply labor inelastically. 
	The resource constraint is given by 
		\[c_{1t} + c_{2t} + k_{t+1} = k_t^\alpha + (1-\delta) k_t\]
	where \(k_t\) denotes the capital stock, and the capital share parameter \(\alpha\) and the depreciation rate \(\delta\) are both positive and less than 1.

	It is convenient to let \(q_t\) denote the price of money (or the inverse of the price level). The representative household's budget constraint is given by 
		\[q_t M_{t+1} + c_{1t} + c_{2t} + k_{t+1} \leq q_t M_t + R_{kt}k_t + w_t l_t + q_t T_t\]
	where \(M_t\) denotes cash balances, \(R_{kt}\) denotes the return to capital, and \(T_t\) denotes lump sum transfers of cash by the government. The household can use a fraction \(\theta\) of its capital stock to purchase cash goods. The cash in advance constraint is 
		\[c_{1t} \leq q_t M_t + \theta k_t\]
</b></p>

<h4>Define a competitive Equilibrium</h4>

<p>A few quick notes: I will assume that labor is supplied inelastically at  \(\overline{l}=1\).  And I will assume that the production function is cobb-douglass; this matches the given resource constraint. I will  write \(r_t\) for the price of renting a unit of capital. Then the return on capital described above is:  \(R_t=1+r_t-\delta \).</p>

<p>
Given parameters \((\beta, \phi, \alpha, \delta, \theta)\), and initial quantities \((\bar{k_0},\bar{M_0} )\), a competitive equilibrium in this economy consists of the following sets:
	<ul>
		<li> An allocation for the representative household: \( HH\equiv \left\{ c_{1t},  c_{2t}, k_{t+1}, M_{t+1} \right\}_{t=0}^\infty \)</li>
		<li>An allocation for the firm: \(\left\{ k^f_{t}, l^f_{t}  \right\}_{t=0}^\infty\)</li>
		<li>Government policy: \(\left\{ M^g_{t}, T_{t}  \right\}_{t=0}^\infty\)</li>
		<li>and Prices: \(\left\{ q_t, r_t, w_t \right\}_{t=0}^\infty  \)</li>
	</ul>
Such that the following conditions are satisfied:
<ul>
		<li><b>HH Optimization</b>: Taking prices and policy as given, the household allocation solves:
				\[\max_{HH} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t (\log c_{1t}+\phi \log c_{2t})\]
			such that:
				\[\bar{k_0}=k_0, \;   M_0 = \bar{M_0}\]
			and for all \(t\geq 0:\)
			\begin{align}
				 c_{1t}\geq 0,\;     c_{2t}\geq 0,\;   &   k_{t+1}\geq 0,\;   M_{t+1}\geq 0    &\;\; \condition{Non-Negativity}\\
				q_t M_{t+1} + c_{1t} + c_{2t} + k_{t+1} & \leq q_t M_t + (1+r_t-\delta)k_t + w_t + q_t T_t   &\;\; \condition{Budget}\\
				c_{1t} & \leq q_t M_t + \theta k_t    &\;\; \condition{CIA}\\
			\end{align}
		</li>
		<li><b>Firm Optimization</b>: Taking prices as given, in each period, the firm's allocation solves
			\[\max_{l_t^f,k_t^f}\; {(k_t^f)}^\alpha {(l_t^f)}^{1-\alpha} - r_t k_t^f - w_t l_t^f\]
		</li>
		<li><b>Gov Budget Balance</b>: In all periods \(t\), the government's budget is balanced:
			\[T_t = M_{t+1}^g - M_t^g\]
		</li>
		<li><b>Markets Clear</b>: In all periods \(t\), 
			\begin{align}
				l_t^f &= \overline{l} = 1 \\
				k_t^f &= k_t   \\ 
				M_t &= M_t^g\\
				c_{1t} + c_{2t} + k_{t+1}  &= k_t^\alpha + (1-\delta) k_t  &\;\; \condition{RC}\\
			\end{align}
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>First Order Conditions:</h4>
<p>
	Assumming an interior solution with nonbinding NNCs,  letting \(\lambda_t\) be the Lagrange Multipliers for the Budget constraints, and letting \(\gamma_t\) be the Lagrange Multipliers for the Cash In Advance constraints, the FOCs are:
	\begin{align}
		{\color{name}c_{1t}:} && {\beta^t \over c_{1t}} &= \lambda_t  + \gamma_t\\ 
		{\color{name}c_{2t}:} && {\phi\beta^t \over c_{2t}} &= \lambda_t \\ 
		{\color{name}k_{t+1}:} && \lambda_t &= \lambda_{t+1}(1+r_{t+1}-\delta) + \theta\gamma_{t+1} \\ 
		{\color{name}M_{t+1}:} && \lambda_t q_t &= \lambda_{t+1}q_{t+1} + \gamma_{t+1}q_{t+1} \\ 
		{\color{name}k^f_{t}:} && r_t &= \alpha {(k_t^f)}^{\alpha-1}{(l_t^f)}^{1-\alpha}=\alpha {k_t}^{\alpha-1}\\ 
		{\color{name}l^f_{t}:} && w_t &= (1-\alpha) {(k_t^f)}^{\alpha}{(l_t^f)}^{-\alpha}=(1-\alpha) {k_t}^{\alpha}\\ 
	\end{align}
	Combining the first order conditions for capital, we get:
		\[ \lambda_t = \lambda_{t+1}(1+\alpha {k_{t+1}}^{\alpha-1}-\delta) + \theta\gamma_{t+1} \]
	These equations, along with the market clearing, CIA, and budget constraints, characterize the equilibrium.
</p>

<h4>Assume that the aggregate stock of money grows at a constant rate, \(\pi\). Characterize the steady state.</h4>
<p>There are two new assumptions in play now:</p>
<p>
	<div class="definition">
			<b>"The aggregate stock of money grows at a constant rate, \(\pi\)":</b><br>
			This means that:
				\[M_t=(1+\pi)M_{t-1}=(1+\pi)^t M_0\]
				\[T_t=M_{t+1}-M_t=(1+\pi-1)M_{t}=\pi(1+\pi)^t M_0\]
			If we define \(\Pi\equiv 1+\pi\), then this is equivalently:
				\[M_t=\Pi M_{t-1}=\Pi^t M_0\]
				\[T_t=(\Pi-1)M_{t}=(\Pi-1)\Pi^t M_0\]
	</div>
	<div class="definition">
			<b>Steady State: </b><br>
			In a steady state, the real allocations are  constant across time. So for all \(t\),
			\begin{align}
				k_t=k   &&   c_{1t}=c_1   &&   c_{2t}=c_2
			\end{align}
			These quantities are such that if \(k_t=k ,\;   c_{1t-1}=c_1,\;   c_{2t-1}=c_2\), then the optimal choice for next-period allocations are \(k_{t+1}=k ,\;   c_{1t}=c_1,\;   c_{2t}=c_2\), and these allocations are also feasible.
	</div>
</p>
<p>
	Rewriting the FOCs, CIA, and Resource Constraint with the above two assumptions:
	\begin{align}
		{\color{name}c_{1}:} && {\beta^t \over c_{1}} &= \lambda_t  + \gamma_t\\ 
		{\color{name}c_{2}:} && {\phi\beta^t \over c_{2}} &= \lambda_t \\ 
		{\color{name}k:} && \lambda_t &= \lambda_{t+1}(1+\alpha {k}^{\alpha-1}-\delta) + \theta\gamma_{t+1}  \\ 
		{\color{name}M_{t+1}:} && \lambda_t q_t &= \lambda_{t+1}q_{t+1} + \gamma_{t+1}q_{t+1} \\  \\
		{\color{name}CIA:} && c_{1} & \leq q_t M_t + \theta k \\
		{\color{name}RC:} &&c_{1} + c_{2}   &= k^\alpha - \delta k \\
	\end{align}
</p>
<p>
	Note that the CIA constraint can be rewritten as \(q_t M_0 \geq {c_1 - \theta k \over \Pi^t M_0}\). 
</p>
If \(c_1 < \theta k\), then the right-hand side of the above is negative, and so the CIA constraint is nonbinding. Suppose otherwise. \(M_t \geq 0\) by the non-negativity constraint, so it must therefore be that \(q_t < 0\).  But \(q_t\) cannot possibly be less than 0, because then the household would demand infinite amounts of money in period \(t+1\), using it to fund infinite amounts of consumption, and so a well-defined solution to the household's optimization problem couldn't exist. Thus, to avoid contradiction, it must be that \(c_1 < \theta k \implies \gamma_t = 0\)
</p>

<h5>Case 1: A monetary equilibrium. Assume the CIA binds with equality each period, \(\gamma_t>0\).</h5>
<p>
	In this case, \(c_{1} = q_t M_t + \theta k\), which implies
		\[q_t = {1 \over M_t}(c_1 -\theta k) \]
		\[\color{red}   {q_{t} \over q_{t+1}} = {M_{t+1} \over M_{t}} = \Pi \]
	So the price of money is decreasing at the same rate as the stock of money is increasing, which means the value of the money stock is in a steady state. \(q_t M_t = q_0 M_0\).
</p>
<p>
	The FOC for money can be rewritten as \(\lambda_t {q_{t} \over q_{t+1}} = {\lambda_{t+1}+\gamma_{t+1}} \). Combine with <font color="red">the above</font> to get:
		\[\color{Rhodamine} \Pi \lambda_t = \lambda_{t+1}+\gamma_{t+1} \]
	Or similarly, \(\color{Rhodamine}\Pi \lambda_t -\lambda_{t+1} = \gamma_{t+1}\).
</p>
<p>
	Also note that from the FOC for the credit good, 
		\[\color{NavyBlue}{\lambda_t \over \lambda_{t+1}} = {\phi \beta^t  \over c_2 } { c_2 \over \phi \beta^{t+1}} = {1 \over \beta} \]
</p>
<p>
	From the FOC for capital, 
	\begin{align}
		(1+\alpha {k}^{\alpha-1}-\delta) &= {\lambda_{t} \over \lambda_{t+1}} - \theta{{\color{Rhodamine} \gamma_{t+1}} \over \lambda_{t+1}} \\
		&= {\lambda_{t} \over \lambda_{t+1}} - \theta{{\color{Rhodamine}\Pi \lambda_t -\lambda_{t+1}  \over \lambda_{t+1}}} \\
		&= (1-\theta \Pi){\color{NavyBlue} {\lambda_{t} \over \lambda_{t+1}}}  +\theta \\
		&= (1-\theta \Pi){\color{NavyBlue} {1 \over \beta }} +\theta \\
	\end{align}
	\[\boxed{\implies k = \left({1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1-\theta \Pi \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]\right)^{1 \over \alpha - 1}}\]
</p>
<p>
	Use the above to relate the FOCs for consumption:
		\[{\beta^{t+1} \over c_{1}} = {\color{Rhodamine} \lambda_{t+1}  + \gamma_{t+1} = \Pi \lambda_t} = \Pi {\phi\beta^t \over c_{2}}  \]
		\[c_2 = {\Pi \phi \over \beta} c_1\]
	And plug this into the Resource Constraint:
		\[c_1 + c_2 = {\beta +\Pi \phi \over \beta }c_1 = k^\alpha - k \]
		\[\boxed{
			\begin{align}
				c_1 &= (k^\alpha - k){\beta \over \beta +\Pi \phi} \\
				c_2 &= (k^\alpha - k){\Pi \phi \over \beta +\Pi \phi} 
			\end{align}
		}\]
</p>
<p>
	And at this point, we can express the equilibrium in terms of exogenous parameters using the above boxed equations, along with:
	\[\boxed{
		\begin{align}
			k_t^f &= k & \\
			l_t^f &= 1 \\
			M_t^g &= M_t = \Pi^t M_0 \\
			T_t &= (\Pi-1)\Pi^t M_0 \\
			w_t &= w \equiv (1-\alpha) k^\alpha \\
			r_t &= r \equiv \alpha k^{\alpha-1} \\
			q_t &= {c_1 - \theta k \over M_t} = {c_1 - \theta k \over \Pi^t M_0}
		\end{align}
	}\]
</p>



<h5>Case 2:  Assume the CIA is nonbinding, \(\gamma_t=0\).</h5>

<p>Then \({\beta^t \over c_1} = \lambda_t = {\beta^t \phi\over c_2} \), and so \({c_2 = \phi c_1}\). Also, as in case 1, \({\lambda_t \over \lambda_{t+1}}={1\over\beta}\).</p>
<p>
	The FOC for capital implies that  \(1+\alpha k^{\alpha-1}-\delta = {\lambda_t \over \lambda_{t+1}} = {1\over\beta}\). Then:
	\[\boxed{\begin{align}
			k &= \left({1\over\alpha}\left[ {1\over\beta}-1+\delta \right]\right)^{1\over \alpha - 1} \\
			c_1 &= {1\over 1+\phi}(k^\alpha - k) \\
			c_2 &= {\phi\over 1+\phi}(k^\alpha - k)
	\end{align}}\]
</p>
<p>
	As for the price of money, \(q_{t+1} = {\lambda_t \over \lambda_{t+1}}q_t = {1\over\beta}q_t\). Setting \(q_t = 0 \;\forall t\) satisfies this condition. And the other characterizing equations are the same as in Case 1.
</p>
<p>
	So if there is a steady state equilibrium with a constantly growing money supply, and if the CIA doesn't bind, then there is such an equilibrium that is nonmonetary. 
</p>



<hr>

<h5>Show that if \(\pi\) is above a critical threshold, the economy has a nonmonetary steady state in which the price of money is zero.</h5>

<p>Observe that in the monetary steady state equilibrium above:
	\begin{align}
		\theta k > c_1 &\iff  \theta k > (k^\alpha - k){\beta \over \beta +\Pi \phi} \\
		& \iff \beta +\Pi \phi > \beta {k^\alpha - k \over \theta k} \\
		& \iff \Pi > {\beta \over \phi \theta}(k^{\alpha-1}-1) - {\beta \over \phi} 
	\end{align}
	And \(k^{\alpha-1} = {1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1-\theta \Pi \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]\), so 
		\begin{align}
			\theta k > c_1 &\iff \Pi  > {\beta \over \phi \theta}({1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1-\theta \Pi \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]-1) - {\beta \over \phi}  \\
			&\iff \Pi + {\Pi \over \alpha\theta} > {\beta \over \phi \theta}({1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1 \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]-1) - {\beta \over \phi}  \\ 
			&\iff \Pi  > {\alpha\theta \over \alpha\theta +1}\left[{\beta \over \phi \theta}({1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1 \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]-1) - {\beta \over \phi}\right] \equiv \bar{\Pi} \\ 
		\end{align}
	Therefore if \(\pi > \bar{\Pi} - 1 \), then \(c_1 - \theta  k < 0\). 
</p>
<p>
	Recall from above that if \(c_1 - \theta  k < 0\), then the CIA is nonbinding, and so it cannot be that \(c_1 - \theta  k < 0\)  in a Case 1 equilibrium. Thus if \(\pi>\bar{\Pi} - 1\), the optimum must be attained in a Case 2 equilibrium, in which case there is a nonmonetary steady state in which the price of money is zero.
</p>

<!--
<p>
	Recall the cash in advance constraint: \(q_t M_t \geq c_1 - \theta k \). For this to bind with equality when \(\pi > \bar{\Pi} - 1 \), it must be that \(q_t M_t < 0\), and \(M_t \geq 0\) by the non-negativity constraint, so it must therefore be that \(q_t < 0\).  
</p>
<p>
	But \(q_t\) cannot possibly be less than 0, because then the household would demand infinite amounts of money in period \(t+1\), using it to fund infinite amounts of consumption, and so a solution to the household's optimization problem couldn't exist. 
</p>
<p>
	Thus, lest a contradiction be induced, it must be that when  \(\pi > \bar{\Pi} - 1 \), the CIA constraint is nonbinding.
</p>-->

<hr>





<h5>Show that below the critical threshold, comparing steady states,  comparing steady states, the capital output ratio	rises as the growth rate of money rises.</h5>

<p>In a monetary steady state, the level of capital is given by:
	\[k = \left({1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1-\theta \Pi \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]\right)^{1 \over \alpha - 1}\]
	This is a decreasing function of \(\Pi\).  And capital output ratio is 
	\[{k \over k^\alpha} = k^{1-\alpha}= \left({1 \over \alpha}\left[ { {1-\theta \Pi \over \beta }} +\theta -1 + \delta \right]\right)^{-1}\]
	This is a decreasing function of \Pi, as that term will now be a negative in the denominator.
</p>
<hr>





<h5>Do your results imply that the Friedman Rule is not optimal in this economy?</h5>

The Friedman Rule is optimal.

<div class="definition">
<b>The Friedman Rule:</b><br>
The  net nominal  interest rate should be set to zero, to alleviate the frictions induced by inflation. Equivalently, the gross nominal interest rate should be 1. <br>
In this economy, it is hepful to note that the nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate times the change in price levels: \(R_t \Pi\)<br>

<img src="FriedmanRule.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" >

</div>

<p>The social optimization problem for this economy is:<blockquote>
		\[\max_{} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t (\log c_{1t}+\phi \log c_{2t})\]
		such that:
			\[\bar{k_0}=k_0\]
		and for all \(t\geq 0:\)
		\begin{align}
			 c_{1t}\geq 0,\;     c_{2t}&\geq 0,\;      k_{t+1}\geq 0,\;     &\;\; \condition{Non-Negativity}\\
			 c_{1t} + c_{2t} + k_{t+1}  &= k_t^\alpha + (1-\delta) k_t  &\;\; \condition{RC}\\
		\end{align}</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
	The First order conditions for the above problem imply that \( c_{2t}=\phi  c_{1t}\). Compare this to the Euler condition from the steady-state monetary competitive equilibrium above, where \(c_{2t}={\phi  \Pi\over \beta}c_{1t}\).  For the competitive equilibrium to attain a social optimum, it must be then that \(\Pi = \beta\).
</p>
<p>
	And also from the competive equilibrium, 
		\begin{align}
			R_t &= 1-\delta + r_t\\
			&= 1-\delta + \alpha k^{\alpha-1} \\
			&= (1-\theta \Pi){ {1 \over \beta }} +\theta\\
			& = (1-\theta \beta){ {1 \over \beta }} +\theta \\
			& = {1 - \theta \beta + \theta\beta \over \beta} = {1\over \beta}
		\end{align}
	</p>

<p>
	So in this economy, the optimal policy will set \(R\Pi={\beta\over\beta}=1\), and the Friedman Rule holds.
