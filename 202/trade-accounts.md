This is one of the few gov sources I can find that uses the phrase capital outflow
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/ERP-2006/pdf/ERP-2006-chapter6.pdf
Even wikipedia only cites Mankiw

> This series has been discontinued as a result of the comprehensive restructuring of the international economic accounts 
Then a link to the following, published 2014:
https://apps.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2014/07%20July/0714_annual_international_transactions_accounts.pdf
which in turn links to BEA's "concepts and methods document for the International Economic Accounts (next block)

(Sadly, this isn't pedgagogically great.)

Here's a table on FRED with the international transactions broken down by category.

NSA version:

Another import export table - don't know difference compared to above

Here's a fed speech that actually uses the term "capital outflow"
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kroszner20070515a.htm
(Thanks kagi!, though google does about as well)
So it isn't EXCLUSIVELY Mankiw that uses the term. 
Though it still doesn't seem to be the main term used by the BEA and similar.

A Primer on the U.S. International Economic Accounts
https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2021/07-july/0721-iea-primer.htm
What I'm looking for is called ITAs by BEA
See here for interactive table of ITA and IIP
https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?ReqID=62
(Remember to click the "Modify" button.)
I think this gives same as tables 996 and 1145 above

Current Account is:
Net Exports
+ Primary Income (investment income and compensation of employees)
+ secondary income (transfers - gov, charity, family, etc)

"Capital Account" now means transfers for things like debt forgiveness or insurance claims.
Seems like it could have just been folded in.

For financial account, BEA uses “net acquisition of financial assets” and “net incurrence of liabilities.”
Or "financial outflow" and "financial inflow" for short.
(Is the term NET FINANCIAL OUTFLOW used anywhere?)

Directly relevant FRED blog post:
https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2017/02/demystifying-the-trade-balance/

The Rest of the world; net lending (+) or borrowing (-) (capital account), Flow (DISCONTINUED) is discontinued
The Rest of the World; Net Lending (+) or Borrowing (-) (Capital Account), Transactions  (RWLBACQ027S) seems like a decent match.
That's from the flow of funds tables.
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1APjc
Later has a link to "Financial Accounts Guide" which isn't super helpful
https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/fof/Default.aspx
But the directory of tables might be useful

Net lending as measured by financial account seems much noiser than as measured by current+capital account

from link 2:
"● Financial transactions are classified into five functional categories: direct investment, portfolio 
investment, other investment, reserve assets (assets 
only), and financial derivatives. Similarly, transactions in primary investment income are classified 
into four functional categories: direct investment, 
portfolio investment, other investment, and reserve 
assets (receipts only). "

TODO: Try to find list of "Principal Federal Economic Indicator"s

TODO: Graph of national saving and investment like Mankiw has.
Private saving doesn't work at all. 
Gross saving lines up with investment pretty well but I don't think that's what I'm looking for. Is it?
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1AP3p
It might be actually. Hrm.
And I could always manually calculate it using Y-C-G but that's cheating.
I also tried looking at (disposable income - C)+gov surplus, but that goes super duper negative.
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1AP9p
Might be thinking about this wrong, and it's a tangent, anyways.
