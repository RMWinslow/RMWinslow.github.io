Suppose we multiplied all dollar amounts in the economy by 100.
Slap a couple 0s onto the end of your paycheck and bank account, 
erase the decimal point from all the price tags, 
do some hasty Sharpie work with the bills in your wallet...
This would make everything *nominally* 100 times as expensive,
and there would be 100 times as many dollars in the economy,
but it wouldn't *really* change much at all.
It would be like if we all just agreed to start measuring things in cents instead of dollars.

The **Neutrality of Money** is the proposition that a change in the money supply 
will affect prices but not the *real* parts of the economy, 
like what we produce and consume.

In the real world, inflation can be harmful for the following reasons:
- Inflation acts as a tax on people who hold onto money.
- Inflation can cause relative prices to fluctuate as the economy adjusts.
    - This is especially problematic when talking about the **real wage**, which is the relative price of labor.
- People have to waste real resources responding to inflation.
    - **Menu Costs** are the resources firms spend to update their prices. This includes literally reprinting menus, but also things like redoing market and figuring out what the new prices *should* be.
    - **Shoe-leather Costs** are the resources wasted when people try to avoid holding onto money. As in, "you'll wear out your shoes going to the bank." These are typically small nowadays, especially with modern payment technology, but in periods of hyperinflation, shoe-leather costs can be rather dramatic.
- Agreements about future payments are often expressed in nominal terms. So unexpectedly high inflation can result in:
    - Unintentionally higher taxes on savings and capital gains.
    - Higher-than-expected real interest rates, which results in a transfer of wealth from lenders to borrowers.

### Unexpected Inflation Transfers Wealth

The Fisher equation says that 

$$\mathinner{\color{purple}{\text{nominal interest}\atop \text{rate}}}\approx\mathinner{\color{blue}{\text{real interest}\atop \text{rate}}}+\mathinner{\color{red}{\text{inflation}\atop \text{rate}}}$$

We can interpret this "ex-ante" as saying that the <span style="color:purple">nominal interest rate</span> is a combination of *expected* $\color{blue}\text{real interest rate}$ and the *expected* <span style="color:red">inflation rate</span>. If I borrow money from you, the <span style="color:purple">extra I promise to pay back</span> reflects compensation for two things: <span style="color:blue">you want to be rewarded with increased purchasing power</span>, and by the time I pay you back, <span style="color:red">the money will be worth less</span>.

$$\mathinner{\color{blue}{\text{real interest}\atop \text{rate}}}\approx\mathinner{\color{purple}{\text{nominal interest}\atop \text{rate}}}-\mathinner{\color{red}{\text{inflation}\atop \text{rate}}}$$

But we can also flip things around and interpret the "ex-post" real interest rate as telling us the interest left over after accounting for inflation.

If inflation is stable and predictable, we get the same numbers either way. But if actual inflation is higher than expected inflation, then real interest rates will be lower than expected as well. This means:

- If inflation is **higher** than expected:
    - Borrowers will pay back **less** than they expected, in real terms.
    - They'll pay back the expected amount of *dollars*, but those dollars will represent fewer resources.
    - This effectively results in a transfer from lenders to borrowers.
- If inflation is **lower** than expected:
    - Borrowers will pay back **more** than they expected, in real terms.
    - This effectively results in a transfer from borrowers to lenders.

### Inflation Taxes Savers

Even when inflation is predictable, high inflation rates still penalizes people who save their money, regardless of whether it's in the form of cash, stocks, or bonds.


When you earn interest from a savings account or a bond, the *nominal* interest counts as income for the sake of taxes ([with some exceptions](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc403)). The decreases the after-tax real returns.

TODO: This has an interesting connection to Fatih's wealth paper Use It or Lose It

Maybe not too interesting albiet.
https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/inflation-can-cause-infinite-effective-tax-rate-capital-gains/
"the effective tax rate on the real (inflation indexed) capital gain has exceeded the statutory rate every year since 1950 and has averaged around 42 percent."
-->

Likewise, with a nominal capital gains tax, if you buy a stock and its value goes up when you sell it, then you'll be taxed even though your real wealth didn't increase.

(And of course, if you save your money by keeping it as cash, you'll be hit by inflation worst of all.)
