Suppose we multiplied all dollar amounts in the economy by 100.
Slap a couple 0s onto the end of your paycheck and bank account, 
erase the decimal point from all the price tags, 
do some hasty Sharpie work with the bills in your wallet...
This would make everything *nominally* 100 times as expensive,
and there would be 100 times as many dollars in the economy,
but it wouldn't *really* change much at all.
It would be like if we all just agreed to start measuring things in cents instead of dollars.

<aside markdown="block">
The **Neutrality of Money** is the proposition that a change in the money supply 
will affect prices but not the *real* parts of the economy, 
like what we produce and consume.
</aside>

In the real world, inflation can be harmful for the following reasons:
- Inflation acts as a tax on people who hold onto money.
- Inflation can cause relative prices to fluctuate as the economy adjusts.
    - This is especially problematic when talking about the **real wage**, which is the relative price of labor.
- People have to waste real resources responding to inflation.
    - **Menu Costs** are the resources firms spend to update their prices. This includes literally reprinting menus, but also things like redoing market and figuring out what the new prices *should* be.
    - **Shoe-leather Costs** are the resources wasted when people try to avoid holding onto money. As in, "you'll wear out your shoes going to the bank." These are typically small nowadays, especially with modern payment technology, but in periods of hyperinflation, shoe-leather costs can be rather dramatic.
- Agreements about future payments are often expressed in nominal terms. So unexpectedly high inflation can result in:
    - Unintentionally higher taxes on savings and capital gains.
    - Higher-than-expected real interest rates, which results in a transfer of wealth from lendors to borrowers.

## Inflation as a Tax


## The Direct Costs of Dealing With Inflation


## Relative Price Changes



Inflation can do real harm to the economy, especially when it's large and unexpected.

Suppose that we all spontaneously agreed to start using pennies instead of dollars as our unit of account.
We could just erase the decimal point from price tags, 
add a couple zeros onto the end of everybody's paycheck,
and do some hasty Sharpie work with the bills in your wallet.
Would that really change anything?

- relative price changes
- menu costs and shoeleather costs
- making it more difficult to save


First, some definitions from Mankiw:

Inflation Tax
: the revenue the government raises by creating money

Fisher Effect
: the one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate

The Inflation Fallacy
: Inflation does not in itself reduce people's real purchasing power.

Shoelether costs
: the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings

menu costs
: the costs of changing prices

relative-price variability

inflation induced tax distortions on capital gains, interest on savings

confusion

redistribution of wealth (from fisher effect)
