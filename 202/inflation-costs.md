First, some definitions from Mankiw:

Inflation Tax
: the revenue the government raises by creating money

Fisher Effect
: the one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate

The Inflation Fallacy
: Inflation does not in itself reduce people's real purchasing power.

Shoelether costs
: the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings

menu costs
: the costs of changing prices

relative-price variability

inflation induced tax distortions on capital gains, interest on savings

confusion

redistribution of wealth (from fisher effect)
