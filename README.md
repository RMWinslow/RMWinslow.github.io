# RMWinslow.github.io

This is the repo I use for my personal website.

Except for the homepage, this site uses [a variant of the Just the Docs theme](https://github.com/RMWinslow/JTD-RMW) for Jekyll.
It automatically populates a navigation sidebar with a collapsible list of nested links.
The main content I "need" for a website is visible in the navigation menu. This includes information about my:

- Teaching Experience
- Research Experience
- Academic Notes
- Shareable Code (TODO)
- CV/Resume (TODO)
- linkedin site, etc. (TODO)

I am using other repositories to store other content on this website.
The pages in these subsite repositories will not show up in the main website's navigation sidebar.
The subsite repositories include:

- A reference site for card game rules: [games repo](https://github.com/RMWinslow/games), [games link](https://games.rmwinslow.com/)
- A not-quite blog which holds a wide variety of posts: [blog repo](https://github.com/RMWinslow/posts), [blog link](https://rmwinslow.com/posts)
- A little piano widget: [piano repo](https://github.com/RMWinslow/tones), [piano link](https://rmwinslow.com/tones)

Todo:
