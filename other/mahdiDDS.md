# Underlying Forces in the Modern Business World

## Abstract
Today’s business world is different from a few decades ago. 
~~The economy is run on big firms. Walmart, Google, Amazon, etc. are now the character of the US economy.~~
**The US economy is now characterized by big firms like Walmart, Google, and Amazon.**
Concurrent with rising market concentration, workers’ share of income has declined, and entry of new firms has slowed down. 
Is their outstanding performance because of their talented manager**s** and
dominant technology or because of their monopoly on ~~the~~ customer data? 
My dissertation answers this through the lens of my model that fits well with the above macroeconomic trends.
My answer has implications for antitrust laws and customer data protection policies.


## Background
Market concentration reflects the degree of ~~the~~ competition in the market. 
~~For instance, consider two cases in the retail industry: 1. Old days with hundreds of local firms with negligible market share and 2. Current situation where Amazon and Walmart sales constitute more than twenty percent of the total sales in the industry. Economists call this a rise in the concentration.~~
**For instance, the retail industry used to have low concentration, with hundreds of local firms, each with negligable market share. But concentration has risen, and now Amazon and Walmart sales constitute more than twenty percent of the total sales in the industry.**
Concentration has been a central issue to ~~the~~ economists because of both efficiency and equity.
Lack of competition might reduce ~~the~~ efficiency as the incumbent firms have less incentive~~s~~ to upgrade their productivity and the quality of their products. 
~~Consider the US economy as a cake. That results in a smaller cake.~~
Moreover, lack of ~~the~~ competition threatens ~~the~~ equity,
~~in favor of big, incumbent firms and against the other firms and the consumers.~~
favoring big, incumbent firms against against their smaller competitors and against consumers.
~~That is having a few people getting the larger slice of the cake.~~
**Think of the US economy like a cake. Less efficiency results in a smaller cake, while less equity means having a few people get a larger slice of the cake.**

Rising concentration in the US economy is recent and significant. 
~~For instance,~~ Autor et. al. (2020) 
document that the average sales share of the top four firms of different industries, has
risen from 41% in 1992 to 45% in 2012. 
The change is as big as 15% in the retail trade.

Higher concentration is accompanied by a declining income share ~~of the~~ for workers. 
Firm revenues are distributed among firm owners (profit), capital owners, and workers. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) report that labor share in the corporate sector declined from 65% in 1975 to 60% in 2012. 
In addition, Calculation of profit share by Akcigit and Ates (2020) reflects a 7%
rise from 1990 to 2012. 
In other words, workers get an increasingly smaller slice of the cake
while firm owners’ slice ~~have~~**has** been expanding.

A third related set of facts is on slower business dynamics. According to Decker et. al.
(2016) firms’ entry rate declined from 14% in 1979 to 8% in 2011 and the ~~employment share of~~ **share of workers employed by**
young firms declined from 18% ~~since~~**in the** early 1980s to 8% in 2011.
These trends have been discussed by several papers in the literature. Different economists
have proposed different mechanisms behind these ~~stylized facts~~**trends** including import shocks (Elsby,
Hobjin, and Sahin 2013), decline in the price of the capital good**s** because of information
technology (Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014), and the “winner takes most” theory (Autor et. al
2020).

There are three gaps in the literature. First, although individual trends have been
extensively discussed, there are very few studying them jointly. Therefore, it is unclear how and
through which mechanism higher concentration relates to lower labor income share and slower
business dynamism. Second, the existing theories refer to black-box forces. It is not clear why
the winner in each industry now gets more market share than before or why information
technology **(IT)** results in lower price**s** of capital goods. Third, the optimality of the new equilibrium is
not addressed. We do not know whether State intervention is needed. Without a framework to
analyze the forces behind the scene**s**, policy discussions such as the optimality of loosening or
tightening ~~the~~ antitrust law make no sense. My research will fill these gaps by proposing a theory
based on specific impacts of IT progress, including more valuable customer data and declining
supervision cost, that generates the three trends together.


## Research Objectives and Timeline

My dissertation will be broken into three chapters. In the first, I propose a new theory
based on declining supervision cost to generate the macro trends discussed above. In the second,
I propose another theory based on increasingly valuable customer data that justifies the same
trends. Finally, I combine the two mechanisms in a single model and quantify the role of each
mechanism. Additionally, I use the ~~ultimate~~**final** structural model to evaluate the welfare impact of
current antitrust law.

The first chapter is almost done. There I develop a new theory of firm size and firm
dynamics. This paper connects business administration theory to macroeconomics. I employ
personnel economics approaches within the span of **the** control model of Lucas (1978). In the model,
supervision cost governs the trends. Growing supervision technology promotes labor
productivity disproportionately in favor of big firms. This results in an expansion of large firms
and concentration. Improved knowledge of human resources and IT based management are
examples of the growing personnel management technology. The only remaining component is
the micro calculation of the management cost. In the data, I consider the salary of non-production
workers as a proxy of the management cost. This model generates the trends in a world with
declining supervision cost and no inefficiency.

The second chapter considers an opposite situation. IT progress allows final good
producers to collect and process ~~the~~ customer data less ~~costly~~**expensively**. That enables them to target
customer preference~~s~~ taste shocks to establish a stable customer base. For example, Netflix
predicts the popularity of ~~the~~ forthcoming movies based on its customers’ records. Therefore,
Netflix knows which movies to ~~bring~~**publish** to keep its customers and to maximize its profit. In the
model, IT progress increases the value of customer data over time as technology allows for more
effective prediction algorithms and cheaper data analysis. Customer data is an intangible capital
attached to the owner of the firm as in Bhandari and McGrattan (2020). Therefore, the profit
share increases, and the income share of the workers declines. Furthermore, establishment of the
customer base ~~rises~~**increases** the markup for the existing firms. Thus, entry rate falls. The model is under
development and to be completed by the end of the spring of 2021. In the summer of 2021, I plan
to structurally estimate the model using simulated method of moments and to quantify the
welfare loss originat~~ed~~**ing** from the higher concentration.

The final chapter will combine the two models to have both the positive and the negative
forces originating from the IT progress: declining supervision cost and more valuable customer
data. 
In the combined model, antitrust policy has a mixed effect. 
*Breaking a big firm is optimal as large firms expel their young competitors relying on their private information from the demand side. In the meantime, it is suboptimal to stop talented managers to run big firms. (Meaning is unclear.)* 
I estimate the combined model and characterize the optimal antitrust policy in terms of the
maximum size and the number of large firms. I plan to prepare the combined model in the fall of
2021 and to estimate and quantify the model in the spring of 2022.


## Professional Goals and Accomplishments

I aim to become a professor of economics at a prominent research university after
graduation. I love the combination of teaching, research, and policy work. For my future
research, I like to study the counterparts of the discussed trends in other big economies. For
example, the African economy experiences a different path where a combination of the foreign
investment and the rise in education attainments have led to rising business dynamism.

In the Ph.D. program at the University of Minnesota, I have the following
accomplishments. In my first year, I was awarded the Bruce and Mildred Mudgett Fellowship of
and won the Dr. Uhlig Award in Macroeconomics for the best score on the macroeconomics
written preliminary examination. I received the Distinguished TA in the first semester I taught. I have been a TA for several undergrad courses including principles of microeconomics, principles
of macroeconomics, uncertainty and information, advanced mathematical economics, and
principles of econometrics. I was awarded the Mythili and Varadarajan Chari Fellowship in my
second year. I was hired by Professor Patrick Kehoe as his RA at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Minneapolis during my third year. I worked on several research projects at the Fed and gained
skills in data analysis and estimation methods. Since the summer of 2020, I ~~am~~**have been** the instructor of
advanced undergrad courses including international trade and public economics, where I teach
70 students and manage a graduate assistant.

I would also like to become a professor of economics to increase the diversity of the
economists’ backgrounds and views in the profession. There are not many economics professors
coming from developing countries, especially the Middle East.

The Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship would enable me to focus on my dissertation
during my fifth year and to complete it in a timely manner.
