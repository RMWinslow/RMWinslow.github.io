<h1>Internet Links</h1>
<p>This page is for urls which are useful tools. They should be organized by category. Only links which I expect to want to return to should be listed here. No narrative articles. Maybe some useful reference material that I expect to use often. If something is an interesting reference, but more the kind of thing that's just interesting to read about and move on, then it goes on the neatlinks page. For example, a table of material densities could go here, while a visualization of animal taxonomy would go on the neatlinks page.</p>
