    <h1>Talk Notes</h1>
    <p>Here is where I keep notes about the talks that I have attended.</p>
    

    <h3>Feb 14: Firm Creation and Local Growth, Conor Walsh</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>New firms create new ideas, they creatively destroy old stuff, and they provide idea diffusion. Lots of important stuff.</li>
        <li>This paper focus on new varieties, and how expanding on the variety margin contributes to local growth.</li>
        <li>Facts: Startuups account for most local employment growth, exit rates unrelated to employment growth, incumber firms mostly invariant. So local growth is mostly about high entry rates.</li>
        <li>Census LBD Longitudianl Business Database, sales data from IRS records</li>
        <li>Growth, he argues, is mostly about extensive entry margin.</li>
        <li>Creative destruction would have high entry be associated with high exit, but don't see that.</li>
        <li>Idea diffusion would have density related to firm growth.</li>
        <li>Model has Workers who can move, Capitalists fixed in place, and Landlords</li>
        <li>Model has entry modelled as combining land and finalgood in the construction sector</li>
        <li>Rust belt story: Firms die all the time. The problem is simply that new firms aren't being made. That's what's causing these towns to die.</li>
    </ul>






    <h3>2020 Jan 29 Micro Workshop</h3>
    
    <h5>Talk from that Indiana person</h5>

    <ul>
    <li>Married women have 40-50% lower volatility in hours worked than other demographics.</li>
    <li>Compared to 1960, married women work 40% more, and hours worked went from 16->20% women.</li>
    <p>So if married women have less labor volatility and there are more married women working, will this lead to less overall volatility in women working? It depends.</p>
    <li>If married women are joining the labor force because their behavior is becoming more similar to a man's, then no.</li>
    <li>If married women wokring more because of less wage gap, then sure.</li>
    <li>Some other third thing I can't recall?</li>
    <p>Also interesting note about how married women often exit the labor force during good times, but don't exit the labor force during bad times. This offsets the married women laid off.</p>






    </ul>

    <h5>Patrick's farm thing.</h5>

    <p>Poor countries tend to have less efficient agriculture sectors, but food is cheaper in these countries. They also seem to have a comparative advantage in manufacturing. But they don't import food. There aren't super high trade costs for grain and stuff, so why don't these poor countres import their food?</p>

    <p>Maybe they can't use capital so wages go way down somehow? Maybe they eat the low-quality food. Or export cash crops and import staples. Or uhh...</p>
