    <ul>
    <li>Agents \(1,2,...,I\)</li>
    <li>Alternatives \(a_1,a_2,...a_K\)</li>
    <li>Each agent partitions the alternatives into subgroups.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>The agent has strict preferences over their subgroups, but is indifferent among options within a subgroup.</li>
        <li>This is basically relaxing things so that indifference  \(\sim\) is allowed in addition to strong preferences \(\succ\)</li>
        <li>Ex: In social choice problems, each subgroup is a singleton.</li>
        <li>Ex: In housing assignment, any two alternatives that give an agent the same house are in the same subgroup for that agent.</li>
        </ul>
    <li></li>
