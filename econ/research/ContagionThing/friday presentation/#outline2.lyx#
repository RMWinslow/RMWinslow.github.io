\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why are people still outside playing sports? Why are people still having
 parties?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core idea: different kinds of people have different structure to their social
 connections.
 The nature of this structure may be important for thinking about whether
 outbreaks of a contagion break out into epidemics or dissapear.
 May also be important for reasoning about how people respond to risk induced
 by social connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic assumptions of how the contagion spreads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start by supposing that you are host to some contagion â€“ a virus,
 an idea, etc.
 And suppose that you have a fixed number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of neighbors, and for each neighbor, you have an independent chance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of transmitting some contagion to that neighbor.
 (For simplicity, none of your neighbors are immune to the contagion.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the expected number of neighbors whom you transmit the contagion
 to? The answer is of course 
\begin_inset Formula $n\cdot r$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what if there are multiple people like you who can transmit the contagion,
 such that each other such person also has 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 neighbors with a chance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of transmitting the contagion? Then in expectation, if there are 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 such people, the group of you will transmit 
\begin_inset Formula $Inr$
\end_inset

 new cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if 
\begin_inset Formula $nr>1$
\end_inset

, then on average, each of you will transmit to more than one person, and
 
\begin_inset Formula $Inr>I$
\end_inset

 so the number of new infectious people has grown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, this resembles the early stages of a standard epidemic model, where
 the disease is growing exponentially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding some structure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, let's impose some additional structure on the network of conections
 between people.
 In principle, we could have contagion spread randomly through any arbitray
 graph, with individuals as nodes and the edges as social connections along
 which the disease can spread.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To keep things simple, I'll make the following assumptions about the structure
 of the social graph: There are some number of distinct 'types' of people,
 indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Each type is defined by the number of connections is has to each other
 type.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{ij}$
\end_inset

 represent the number of connections a type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 person has to type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 people.
 Suppose that each of these groups is very large and that the connections
 are chosen at random, save for the fact about which group they connect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the number of infectious people of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 And let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the portion of infectious people who are of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}\equiv\frac{I_{i}}{\sum_{k}I_{k}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the total number of expected new tranmission events?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the number of new transmission events divided by the number of currently
 infectious?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]}{\sum_{h}I_{h}}=\sum_{k}\left[\frac{I_{k}}{\sum_{h}I_{h}}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]=\sum_{k}\left[\Phi_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what is the expected number of new transmission events where the contagion
 is specifically transmitted to a person of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}rn_{ki}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore the portion of the newly infected who are of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 will be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Phi_{i}^{\prime} & =\frac{\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}rn_{ki}\right]}{\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]}\\
 & =\frac{\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}rn_{ki}\right]}{\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]}\cdot\frac{\left(\frac{1}{r\sum_{h}I_{h}}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{r\sum_{h}I_{h}}\right)}\\
 & =\frac{\sum_{k}\left[\left(\frac{I_{k}}{r\sum_{h}I_{h}}\right)n_{ki}\right]}{\sum_{k}\left[\left(\frac{I_{k}}{r\sum_{h}I_{h}}\right)\sum_{j}rn\right]}\\
 & =\frac{\sum_{k}\left[\Phi_{k}n_{ki}\right]}{\sum_{k}\left[\Phi_{k}\sum_{j}rn\right]}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the later stages of a contagion, some of the neighbors of an infestious
 individual may be immune to the contagion.
 But in the early stages, the dynamics are described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fixed Point results and other dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, holding the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{..}$
\end_inset

 constant, the system of equations describing each 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is a mapping from a probability distribution to itself, which doesn't depend
 on the transmission rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, I'm splitting up two questions about how the contagion spreads:
 how does the distribution of types amongst the infected evolve?, and does
 the incidence of the infection grow or shrink?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First let's note a few things about this mapping that describes how the
 probability distribution evolves.
 Because it's a continous mapping from a simplex to the same simplex, there
 must be at least one fixed point.
 This fixed point is not necessarily unique.
 If the connecton parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \eta\right\} $
\end_inset

 are chosen such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ij}\neq0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

 , then the fixed point must be in the interior of the probability.
 simplex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the latter case, subsequent generations of infectious will evolve to
 have a distribution of types which converges to the fixed distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the question of whether the contagion can spread to a large portion
 of the network depends on the average number of new tranmissions per person
 among this distribution of infectious people.
 So if the distribution evolves in such a way as to concentrate the contagion
 among the highly connected, then an outbreak is more likely to occur than
 would be suggested by the transmissions caused by a randomly selected person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Insert image of hyperplane and tranmission threshold]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then after the distribution evolves in a way determined by the structure
 of connections between types, the number of new transmissions per infectious
 person will be a weighted sum of the average number of transmissions per
 type of person 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k}\left[\Phi_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the contagion will increase in prevalence iff this quantity is 
\begin_inset Formula $>1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Continuous example with two distinct types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
your percentage 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{I_{i}}{I}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the rate of change of your percentage 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\Phi_{i}}{\partial t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{I_{i}}{I}=\frac{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}I_{i}\right)\left(I\right)-\left(I_{i}\right)\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}I\right)}{\left(I^{2}\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we assume that the rate of change of a population is proportional to
 the size of the group it is spreading from, then when 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}\approx1$
\end_inset

, and that recovery happens randomly at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}I_{i}=\sum_{j}\left[r\eta_{ji}I_{j}\right]-\gamma I_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $I=\sum_{k}I_{k}$
\end_inset

, we get that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}I=\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[r\eta_{jk}I_{j}\right]-\gamma I_{k}\right)=\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[r\eta_{jk}I_{j}\right]\right)-\gamma I
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{I_{i}}{I}=\frac{\left(\sum_{j}\left[r\eta_{ji}I_{j}\right]-\gamma I_{i}\right)\left(I\right)-\left(I_{i}\right)\left(\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[r\eta_{jk}I_{j}\right]\right)-\gamma I\right)}{\left(I^{2}\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{I_{i}}{I} & =r\frac{\left(\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}I_{j}\right]-\gamma I_{i}\right)\left(I\right)}{\left(I^{2}\right)}-r\frac{I_{i}\left(\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{jk}I_{j}\right]\right)-\gamma I\right)}{\left(I^{2}\right)}\\
 & =r\frac{\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}I_{j}\right]-\gamma I_{i}}{I}-r\frac{I_{i}}{I}\frac{\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{jk}I_{j}\right]\right)-\gamma I}{I}\\
 & =r\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}\frac{I_{j}}{I}\right]-r\gamma\frac{I_{i}}{I}-r\frac{I_{i}}{I}\left[\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{jk}\frac{I_{j}}{I}\right]\right)-\gamma\right]\\
 & =r\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}\frac{I_{j}}{I}\right]-\xcancel{r\gamma\frac{I_{i}}{I}}-r\frac{I_{i}}{I}\sum_{k}\left(\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{jk}\frac{I_{j}}{I}\right]\right)+\xcancel{r\frac{I_{i}}{I}\gamma}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{i} & =r\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}\Phi_{j}\right]-r\Phi_{i}\sum_{k}\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{jk}\Phi_{j}\right]\\
 & =r\sum_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}\Phi_{j}-\Phi_{i}\sum_{k}\left[\eta_{jk}\Phi_{j}\right]\right]\\
 & =r\sum_{j}\left[\Phi_{j}\left[\eta_{ji}-\Phi_{i}\sum_{k}\eta_{jk}\right]\right]\\
 & =r\left[\sum_{j}\eta_{ji}\left[\Phi_{j}-\Phi_{j}\Phi_{i}\right]-\Phi_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k\neq i}\Phi_{j}\eta_{jk}\right]\\
 & =r\sum_{j}\left[\Phi_{j}\left[\left(1-\Phi_{i}\right)\eta_{ji}-\Phi_{i}\sum_{k\neq i}\eta_{jk}\right]\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Weird how the recovery rate cancels out.
 It's still implicitly there in the form of the rate of transmission 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 chance of transmission each period and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 periods of infectiveness on average then overall chance of transmission
 is only 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{\gamma}$
\end_inset

.
 So recovery rate only matters for the evolution of distribution insomuch
 as it affects transmission rate, and tranmission rate only effects speed
 of adjustment.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, with only two groups, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1} & =r\sum_{j=1,2}\left[\Phi_{j}\left[\eta_{j1}-\Phi_{1}\sum_{k=1,2}\eta_{jk}\right]\right]\\
 & =r\left[\Phi_{1}\left[\eta_{11}-\Phi_{1}\left[\eta_{11}+\eta_{12}\right]\right]+\Phi_{2}\left[\eta_{21}-\Phi_{1}\left[\eta_{21}+\eta_{22}\right]\right]\right]\\
 & =r\left[\Phi_{1}\eta_{11}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\eta_{11}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\eta_{12}+\Phi_{2}\eta_{21}-\Phi_{2}\Phi_{1}\eta_{21}-\Phi_{2}\Phi_{1}\eta_{22}\right]\\
 & =r\left[\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[\Phi_{2}-\Phi_{2}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{22}\Phi_{2}\Phi_{1}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{2} & =r\sum_{j=1,2}\left[\Phi_{j}\left[\eta_{j2}-\Phi_{2}\sum_{k=1,2}\eta_{jk}\right]\right]\\
 & =r\left[-\eta_{11}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{2}+\eta_{12}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{2}\right]+\eta_{21}\Phi_{2}\Phi_{2}+\eta_{22}\left[\Phi_{2}-\Phi_{2}\Phi_{2}\right]\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}=r\left[\underbrace{\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]}_{positive}\underbrace{-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}}_{negative}\underbrace{+\eta_{21}\left[\Phi_{2}-\Phi_{2}\Phi_{1}\right]}_{positive}\underbrace{-\eta_{22}\Phi_{2}\Phi_{1}}_{negative}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that stationary point doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 only affects the speed at which convergence happens.
 Then it also matters for whether the outbreak is above one of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh wait, forgot the healing factor.
 People recover.
 They don't just keep on infecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, with only two groups, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{2}=1-\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}=r\left[\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)-(1-\Phi_{1})\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{22}\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
=r\left[\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[1-2\Phi_{1}+\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{22}\left(\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
=r\left[\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[1-\Phi_{1}\right]^{2}-\eta_{22}\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
=r\left[\left(\eta_{11}-\eta_{22}\right)\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[1-\Phi_{1}\right]^{2}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are at the stationary point, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[1-\Phi_{1}\right]^{2}-\eta_{22}\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{11}\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}+\eta_{21}\left[1-\Phi_{1}\right]^{2}=\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}+\eta_{22}\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{11}+\eta_{21}\frac{1-\Phi_{1}}{\Phi_{1}}=\eta_{12}\frac{\Phi_{1}}{\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)}+\eta_{22}
\]

\begin_layout Subsection*
Analysis of the two-group scenario:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note how each of the following chunks responds to changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $+\eta_{11}\left[\Phi_{1}-\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]$
\end_inset

: Increases until 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 reaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 then starts decreasing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $+\eta_{21}\left[1-\Phi_{1}\right]^{2}$
\end_inset

: decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Higher portion means slower growth from the other portion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

: increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 which means the whole term is decreasing of course.
 Higher portion means more bleeding off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $-\eta_{22}\left(1-\Phi_{1}\right)\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

: same as first part.
 Just negative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So two of the pieces decrease when we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the other two pieces add up to a parabola with the peak at 0.5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}=r\eta_{21}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}=-r\eta_{12}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore if 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{21}=0$
\end_inset

, we have a steady state at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and if 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{21}=0$
\end_inset

, then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 as stable state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
No self propagation:

\begin_layout Standard
If

\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1} & =r\left[\eta_{21}\left[1-\Phi_{1}\right]^{2}-\eta_{12}\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]\\
 & =r\left[\eta_{21}-2\eta_{21}\Phi_{1}+\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]\Phi_{1}\Phi_{1}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set equal to zero and solve.
 Then solutions are:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Phi_{1} & =\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\\
 & =\frac{2\eta_{21}\pm\sqrt{4\eta_{21}^{2}-4\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]}}{2\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]}\\
 & =\frac{2\eta_{21}\pm2\sqrt{\eta_{21}\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}+\eta_{12}}}{2\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b=-2\eta_{21}$
\end_inset

 , and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there will always be two real solutions here.
 But is one of them inside of the correct range? Well, yes, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{21}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{12}\neq0$
\end_inset

, then by IVT there is some value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 between 0 and 1 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 See above for how 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi_{1}<0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vertex of parabola is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\eta_{21}}{\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{21}>\eta_{12}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

 parabola is concave up, and fixed point is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=\frac{\eta_{21}-\sqrt{\eta_{21}\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}+\eta_{12}}}{\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]}$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise if 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{12}>\eta_{21}$
\end_inset

, then parabola is concave down, denominator is negative and fixed point
 is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=\frac{\eta_{21}-\sqrt{\eta_{21}\eta_{21}-\eta_{21}+\eta_{12}}}{\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]}$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So either way, fixed point is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1}=\frac{\eta_{21}-\sqrt{\eta_{21}\eta_{21}-\eta_{21}+\eta_{12}}}{\left[\eta_{21}-\eta_{12}\right]}$
\end_inset

A note about endogenizing the network connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above sections look at the question of how the contagion evolves on
 a fixed network of social connections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But another interesting question is how the network of connections will
 itself evolve in response to the contagion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you are an individual with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 social contacts.
 You are susceptible to the contagion, and you know that all else being
 equal, some portion 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of your contacts will eventually get the contagion and become infectious
 before the end of the outbreak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood that you 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 get the contagion transmitted to you from any particular one of your contacts
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pr(\text{that contact doesn't get infected}\lor\text{they don't sneeze on you})
\]
