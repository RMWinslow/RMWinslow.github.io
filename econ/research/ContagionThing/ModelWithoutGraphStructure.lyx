\begin_layout Section*
How likely are you to get infected this period?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
As function of number of infected neighbors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have contact with one infected person, then chance is 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If contact with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 infected people, chance is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-(1-r)^{n}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Number of infected neighbors vs Risk, with each line representing a different
 transmission rate (
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 varies from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 with step 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05$
\end_inset

):

\begin_layout Subsection*
As function of number of general neighbors and prevelance of disease:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But not all neighbors infected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume each neighbor being infected is IID.
 (Not True! And the fact that it's not true is an important fact about social
 networks.) But assume.
 Then # of infected neigbors = # of neighbors times prevelance of infection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of neighbors you have, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is the percentage of the population infected, and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the infection rate per infected neighbor, then the chance of you getting
 infected today is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{N}prob(nInfectedNeighbors)\cdot\left(1-(1-r)^{n}\right)=
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left(\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}r^{n}p^{n-k}\right)\cdot\left(1-(1-r)^{n}\right)=
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or wait.
 Risk of catching it from any particular neighbor is 
\begin_inset Formula $ir$
\end_inset

.
 So risk of catching it from at least one neighbor is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-(1-ir)^{N}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Number of infected neighbors vs Risk, with each line representing a different
 transmission rate.
 Equivalent to #neighbors vs effective risk, with each line representing
 a different rate 
\begin_inset Formula $ir.$
\end_inset

 Here, I've done the same as above but had 
\begin_inset Formula $ir$
\end_inset

 vary from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

 with step 
\begin_inset Formula $0.005$
\end_inset

:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seems roughly proportional to number of neighbors for low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $ir$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Two distinct groups of neighbors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you have two distinct types of neighbors.
 Type 1 and type 2.
 You have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}$
\end_inset

 type 1 neighbors, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 type 2 neighbors.
 Each type has different prevalence of disease 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1},i_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 But transmission rate is the same.
 Then chance you will get infected today is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\left[\left(1-i_{1}r\right)^{N_{1}}\left(1-i_{2}r\right)^{N_{2}}\right]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But again, let's keep things simple for now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Simplified formula for infection risk:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of the above formula, suppose the risk of getting infected if you
 have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{type}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $type$
\end_inset

 neighbors and each 
\begin_inset Formula $type$
\end_inset

 neighbor has iid 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{type}$
\end_inset

 chance of having the disease, and an infected neighbor has chance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 of spreading the disease to you, then your chance of getting infected is
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{types}\left(r\cdot i_{type}\cdot N_{type}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
remember, this isn't actually how it works.
 This, first assumes that your nieghbors don't have correlated chances of
 getting infected, which isn't true (see the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clustering coefficient
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and secondly approximates away the binomial stuff, which is only a reasonable
 approximation when the values of each 
\begin_inset Formula $ir$
\end_inset

 are teeny tiny.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Herd Immunity Threshold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the standard SIR model if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I^{\prime}=I-\rho I+rSI
\]

\end_inset

then newly infected is going to be 
\begin_inset Formula $rSI$
\end_inset

 and will start dropping once 
\begin_inset Formula $(rS-\rho)I<0$
\end_inset

 so once 
\begin_inset Formula $rS<\rho$
\end_inset

 so once 
\begin_inset Formula $S<\frac{\rho}{r}$
\end_inset

.
 So with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=1$
\end_inset

, infected will start decaying once 
\begin_inset Formula $S<20\%$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
With multiple types of people,
