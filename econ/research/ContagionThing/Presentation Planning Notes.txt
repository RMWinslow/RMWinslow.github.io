O ring theory









Virus automata
    Simplex
    Connections to all 8 neighbors


    Observation: Spread throughout graph. If no randomness, time is equal to diameter of graph


Can a reduction in average outdegree increase the rate of spread?
    Increase the connections within families?

Graph Theory
    Network Theory
        Electric network analysis
            Susceptibility of electrical networks to failures in specific nodes
                Reverse to consider how to target specific social nodes?

        Social network analysis
        Network robustness
    Centrality
        Eigenvector centrality:  A high eigenvector score means that a node is connected to many nodes who themselves have high scores. Like google search ranks
        Degree centrality is just degree. 
            Graph centralization compares these to star graph
        Closeness centrality:
            Average length of shortest path to each other node
        Betweenness Centrality: the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.
        Percolation Centrality: Portion of percolated paths that go through this node
            Percolation Theory - Eh, not quite relevant. More of a materials science thing.
                Percolation threshold: What portion of bonds or nodes need to be filled to get large scale connectivity
                    ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT

    Complex Network
        Scale-free network: Power law distribution of Degree
        Small-world network: short paths. Neighbor are likely to be neighbors.

    Spread
    Clustering
        Networks with the Smallest Average Distance and the Largest Average Clustering
    Immunization
        Immunization of complex networks
    Interdependent Networks
    Assortive Mixing

    The Structure and Dynamics of Networks 


    can removing edges ioncrease disease spread?
    Effect on percolation?



Networks and epidemic models: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1578276/

Kremer has two papers about the aids epidemic.

What you can provide new is endogenizing the network.


-real world examples related to patient 31

-Present two graphs. The latter has reduced connctions but increased centrality and so greater disease spread
-Relate to epidemic transmission
-Implications for policy? Cite electric grid papers about Susceptibility to damage, cite immunization?
-Argue that in the presence of extroverts who refuse to distance, it is more important to, say, put up blast shields at the grocery store.
-optimal allocation of ppe

5 minutes - Refresher of Graph Theory Terms
    Vertex, Edge, mention the axon thing,
    matrix representation
    path, neighbors, degree
    metion the thing abuot multiple edges, loops, direction, and weight
10 minutes - Examples of Graphs
    Complete graph
    star graph
    lattice
    random graph
        number line, grid
Resilience of graphs
    Compare star graph and ring. Remove a point and see what happens
    Compare small world with random graph. Remove a connection and see what happens





INTERSETING TIDBITS
Percolation Threshold is computed for lattices with duals.
can assign an order to edges to nest possible graphs within each other,
Does an infinite graph have a path of infinite length. Or an infinite connected component?

Variability in connectivity lowering the percolation threshold?

percolation threshold for complete graph is 1/N, where N is number of vertices
 Erdős–Rényi graph where {\displaystyle p_{c}=1/{\bar {k}}}{\displaystyle p_{c}=1/{\bar {k}}}, where {\displaystyle {\bar {k}}}{\displaystyle {\bar {k}}} is the average degree
"Localized Attacks" - Remove a neighbor and then its neighbor

which, as described in detail in Section 4.2,
is a model of a social network that introduces clustering (or network transitivity)
into the random graph in a controlled way.
