- Motivation
    - relatives sick
    - graph theory stuff is neato
    - Transmission through networks
      - Percolation threshold
         - On random graphs and on graphs with a specific structure
         - Tells us whether an "outbreak" will become an "epidemic" and spread to an infinite number of nodes 
    - Not looking at:
      - the time path of how a disease spreads
        - (Sort of time invariant approach)
      - The mortality or costs involved.

- Model
    â€“ Tranmission
        - always happens at rate r
        - If you have n outneighbors, its expected that your case will cause an additional n*r new cases
        - If there is a total population *I* of your type, then together you'll create Inr new cases.
        - If nr > 1, then on average cases will grow.
    - population structure
      - Split into types indexed by *i*
      - types are defined by  the number of connections is has to each other type.
      - infinite population of each type, so I'm not worrying about susceptibility and the like
      - parameters n_ij tell us the number of outdegrees from a type i node to a type j node
      - Suppose that each of these groups is very large and that the connections are chosen at random, save for the fact about which group they connect.
    - Obvious consequences
      - let \Phi_{i} be the portion of infectious people who are of type i. So $$\Phi_{i}\equiv\frac{I_{i}}{\sum_{k}I_{k}}$$.
      - expected number of new transmission events is 
      \[\sum_{k}\left[I_{k}\sum_{j}rn_{kj}\right]\]

- Proposition 1
