    Desirable Properties:

    * Universal. Every profile of rational preferences is possible.
    * Social Preferences are rational. 
    * Unanimous. So if everybody likes eggs better than bacon, we won't choose bacon.
    * Independent. So if reltive orderings are preserved across preference profiles, then the relative ordering on the social preferences is also preserved.
    * Not Dictatorial



    Decisiveness. A coalition is decisive for a over b if they are collectively dictatorial for a over b. Decisive coalition is collectively dictatorial.

    If a colation is decisive, then split that coalition in two. One of the two subcoaltions is decisive.
    Confused about this step.

    If a colation is decisive over one alternative, then it is decisive over everythign

    ordinal vs cardinal


    * Independent of irrelevant alternatives. (Reference economist magazine subscription plan)


    Xavier
    10 bucks
    a costs 1, b costs .5

    preferences are ln a  + ln b

    At optimum, 1/b = 0.5 1/a    ->    a=0.5b.  5 apples, 10 bananas.




    
    Yorick
    10 bucks
    a costs 1, b costs 1
    5 apples, 5 bananas.




    Xavier
    10 bucks
    a costs 1, b costs .5
    preferences are now ln a + 0.5 ln b

    at optimum, a=b
