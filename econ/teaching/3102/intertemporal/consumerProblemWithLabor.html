<h1>Two-Period Consumer's Problem with Production</h1>


<p>The consumer's problem is 
    \[\max_{c,c',l,l',s_p} u(c,l) + \beta u(c',l') \]
    \[ s.t. c\geq 0, c'\geq 0, 0 < l < h, 0 < l' < h' \]
    \[ c + s_p \leq w(h-l) + \pi - t \]
    \[ c' \leq (1+r)s_p + w'(h'-l') + \pi' -t' \]
</p>

<p> solving for s, and combining the BCs, we can get a single present value budget constraint:
    \[ c+ {c'\over 1+r} \leq [w(h-l)+\pi-t] + {[w'(h'-l')+\pi'-t'] \over 1+r} \]
</p>

<p>Suppose that \(u(c,l) = \log c + \log l\)


Taking \(\lambda\) to be the langragian multiplier for the present value budget constraint, the FOCs are:

    \[U_c = {1\over c}=\lambda\]
    \[U_{c'} = {\beta \over c'}={\lambda \over 1+r}\]
    \[U_l = {1 \over l}=w\lambda\]
    \[U_{l'} = {\beta \over l'}= {w'\lambda \over 1+r}\]

Now dividing these by each other, we can find the marginal rates of substituion at the optimum:

    \[MRS_{l,c} = {U_l \over U_c} = {c \over l} = w\]
    \[MRS_{l',c'} = {U_{l'} \over U_{c'}} = {c' \over l'} = w'\]
    \[MRS_{c,c'} = {U_c \over U_{c'}} = {c' \over \beta c} = 1+r\]

Therefore
    \[ l = {1 \over w} c\]
    \[ c' = (1+r)\beta c \]
    \[ l' = {c' \over w'} = {(1+r)\beta \over w'}c \]

Plugging this into the budget constraint (which holds with equality because of our choice of utility):
    \[ c+ \beta c = [wh-c+\pi-t] + {[w'h'-\beta(1+r)c+\pi'-t'] \over 1+r} \]
    \[ c = {1 \over (2+2\beta)} \left([wh+\pi-t] + {[w'h'+\pi'-t'] \over 1+r}\right)  \]

Now we have a formula for c in terms of lifetime wealth, and we can solve for our other choice variables by plugging in c. In particular, the formula for period-one leisure is now:
    \[l = {1 \over (2+2\beta)} \left([wh-c+\pi-t] + {[w'h'+\pi'-t'] \over 1+r}\right)\]

In particular, note three things about this expression:<br>
    As wages increase, leisure decreases and so labor supplied increases.<br>
    As interest rate increases, leisure decreases and so labor supplied increases.<br>
    An increase in lifetime wealth increases leisure and so decreases labor supplied.<br>
