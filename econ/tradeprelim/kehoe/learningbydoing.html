\section*{Consider an economy in which the consumption space is the set of
    functoins $c:R_{+}\times R_{+}\to R_{+}$. In $c(x,t)$ the index
    $x$ denotes the type of good and the index $t$ denotes the date
    at which it is consumed. An individual consumer has preferences given
    by the functional }
    
    \[
    u(c)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\rho t}\left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\log(c(x,t)+1)dx\right]dt
    \]
    
    Goods are produced using a single factor of production, labor:
    \[
    y(x,t)=\frac{l(x,t)}{a(x,t)}
    \]
    
    Each consumer has an endowment of labor equal to l, and the total
    number of consumers is fixed at $\bar{l}$. The unit labor requirement
    $a(x,t)$ is bounded from below, $a(x,t)$>$\bar{a}(x,t)=e^{-x}$.
    At $t=0$, there is a $z(0)>0$ such that $a(x,0)=e^{-x}$ for all
    $x<z(0)$ and that $a(x,0)=e^{x-2z(0)}$ for all $x\geq z(0).$ There
    is learning by doing of the form 
    \[
    \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}a(x,t)}{a(x,t)}=\begin{cases}
    -\int_{0}^{\infty}b(v,t)l(v,t)dv & \text{if }a(x,t)>\bar{a}(x,t)\\
    0 & \text{if }a(x,t)=\bar{a}(x,t)
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \[
    b(v,t)=\begin{cases}
    b>0 & a(v,t)>\bar{a}(v,t)\\
    0 & a(v,t)=\bar{a}(v,t)
    \end{cases}
    \]
    
    
    \section*{(a) Provide a motivation for both the utility function and the production
    technology described above.}
    
    The utility function's inner integral reflects consumers who like
    having a variety of goods but are content with (don't get infinitely
    negative utility from) consuming 0 of some non-zero measure of goods.
    This reflects that some goods are too advanced to be worth the cost,
    while others become outdated.
    
    The motivation for the prodcution function is that goods vary in the
    level of technological sopistication needed to make them. Goods beyond
    the technological 'frontier' of a society are increasingly difficult
    to make. A neolithic society could in principle make a large mechanical
    computer, but doing so would take so much time and effort that everyone
    would starve. But these same technologies that are initially difficult
    to make also tend to be less labor intensive once fully researched.
    
    And the more people working on advanced technology, the faster the
    frontier of technology is moved outward.
    
    Population growth feedback loop?
    
    \section*{(b) Define the equilibrium and characterize as much as possible.}
    
    Note that there is no storage, or intertemporal trade, so consumption
    cannot be smoothed over time.
    
    An equilbirum consists of prices $w(t),P(x,t)$ and consumption allocations
    $c(x,t)$ and labor allocations $l(x,t)$ such that 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Given prices, consumers choose $c(x,t)$ so that at each time $c(x,t)$
    maximizes 
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\rho t}\left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\log(c(x,t)+1)dx\right]dt
    \]
    \[
    \ni\int_{0}^{\infty}P(x,t)c(x,t)dx\leq w(t)\ \forall t
    \]
    \[
    c(x,t)\geq0
    \]
    \item Given prices, firms choose labor to maximize 
    \[
    \max_{l(x,t)}\left[p(x,t)\frac{l(x,t)}{a(x,t)}-w(t)l(x,t)\right]
    \]
    \item Perfectly competitive firms:
    \[
    P(x,t)=w(t)a(x,t)
    \]
    \item Non-negativity in prices
    \item Markets clear. For all x,t:
    \[
    y(x,t)a(x,t)=l(x,t)\ \ \ \forall x,t
    \]
    \[
    \bar{l}c(x,t)=y(x,t)=\frac{l(x,t)}{a(x,t)}
    \]
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\infty}l(x,t)dx=\bar{l}
    \]
    \item The production function evolves as a fucntional of $l(x,t)$ as described:
    \[
    \bar{a}(x,t)\equiv e^{-x}
    \]
    \[
    \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}a(x,t)}{a(x,t)}=\begin{cases}
    -\int_{0}^{\infty}b(v,t)l(v,t)dv & \text{if }a(x,t)>\bar{a}(x,t)\\
    0 & \text{if }a(x,t)=\bar{a}(x,t)
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \[
    b(v,t)=\begin{cases}
    b>0 & a(v,t)>\bar{a}(v,t)\\
    0 & a(v,t)=\bar{a}(v,t)
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \end{itemize}
    \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash \textemdash{}
    
    \subsubsection*{There is some cutoff productivity.}
    
    Because there is no storage, and consumers are identical, budget constraint
    is period by period. And with perfect competition, the budget becomes
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\infty}a(x,t)c(x,t)dx\leq1
    \]
    
    FOC for any $c(x,t)>0$ is thus:
    \[
    \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial c(x,t)}=\frac{1}{c(x,t)+1}-\lambda_{t}a(x,t)
    \]
    
    \[
    c(x,t)=\frac{1}{\lambda_{t}a(x,t)}-1
    \]
    \[
    \frac{1}{a(x,t)\left(c(x,t)+1\right)}=\lambda_{t}
    \]
    
    Define $\tilde{a_{t}}\equiv\frac{1}{\lambda_{t}}$. Then for all $c(x,t)>0,$
    \begin{align*}
    c(x,t) & =\frac{\tilde{a_{t}}}{a(x,t)}-1
    \end{align*}
    
    \[
    c(x,t)a(x,t)=\tilde{a_{t}}-a(x,t)
    \]
    
    And if $a(x,t)>\tilde{a_{t}}$, $c(x,t)$ must then be zero. Thus
    $\tilde{a_{t}}$ is a cutoff value, and goods are produced iff they
    have better productivity than the cutoff.
    
    \subsubsection*{The shape is always symetric around some point.}
    
    Because $\frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}a(x,t)}{a(x,t)}$ is the
    same for all $x$ such that $a(x,t)>e^{-x}$, $a(x,t)=\max\left\{ e^{-x},\alpha(t)e^{x-2z(0)}\right\} $for
    some scaling factor $\alpha(t)$
    
    Also note that $\alpha(t)e^{x-2z(0)}=e^{x-2z(t)}$ where $z(t)\equiv z(0)-\frac{1}{2}\log\alpha(t)$.
    And $e^{-x}=\alpha(t)e^{x-2z(0)}$at $x=z(t).$ So at any time $t$,
    there is a $z(t)>0$ such that $a(x,t)=e^{-x}$ for all $x<z(t)$
    and that $a(x,t)=e^{x-2z(t)}$ for all $x\geq z(t).$ 
    
    Thus the productivity is always symetric around the point $z(t)$.
    And 
    \[
    a(x,t)=\max\left\{ e^{-x},\alpha(t)e^{x-2z(t)}\right\} 
    \]
    
    
    \subsubsection*{z(t) is the midpoint of the range of goods being produced}
    
    Assuming that the economy is sufficiently advanced that none of good
    0 is produced in equilibirum at time $t$, we can then find $M_{t}$
    and $N_{t}$ such that $a(M_{t},t)=\tilde{a_{t}}=a(N_{t},t)$. and
    $\tilde{a_{t}}=e^{-M_{t}}=e^{N_{t}-2z(t)}$. Note that $-M_{t}=N_{t}-2z(t)$.
    Thus $z(t)-M_{t}=N_{t}-z(t)$, and so $z(t)$ is the midpoint between
    these two values
    
    Because of this and the fact that productivity is symetric around
    $z(t),$ 
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\infty}b(v,t)l(v,t)dv=\int_{z(t)}^{M_{t}}bl(v,t)dv=\frac{b}{2}\int_{N_{t}}^{M_{t}}l(v,t)dv=\frac{\bar{l}b}{2}
    \]
    
    
    \subsubsection*{Find the value for z(t)}
    
    Note that in general 
    \[
    \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}f(t)}{f(t)}=k\implies f(t)=f(0)e^{\left(kt\right)}
    \]
    
    Applying this to the scaling factor described above, 
    
    \begin{align*}
    \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\alpha(t)e^{x-2z(0)}}{\alpha(t)e^{x-2z(0)}} & =-\int_{0}^{\infty}b(v,t)l(v,t)dv=-\frac{\bar{l}b}{2}\\
    \alpha(t)e^{x-2z(0)} & =e^{x-2z(0)}e^{\left(-\frac{\bar{l}b}{2}t\right)}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
    \alpha(t) & =e^{\left(-\frac{\bar{l}b}{2}t\right)}\\
    e^{-z(t)} & =e^{\left(-\frac{\bar{l}b}{2}t\right)}e^{z(t)-2z(0)}\\
    z(t) & =z(0)+\frac{\bar{l}b}{4}t
    \end{align*}
    
    
    \subsubsection*{Find the value for $\tilde{a_{t}}$.}
    
    Note that 
    \[
    \tilde{a_{t}}e^{z(t)}=e^{z(t)-M_{t}}=e^{\frac{1}{2}\left(N_{t}-M_{t}\right)}
    \]
    
    \begin{align*}
    1=\int_{0}^{\infty}a(x,t)c(x,t)dx & =\int_{M_{t}}^{N_{t}}\left(\tilde{a_{t}}-a(x,t)\right)dx\\
     & =\int_{M_{t}}^{z(t)}\left(\tilde{a_{t}}-e^{-x}\right)dx+\int_{z(t)}^{N_{t}}\left(\tilde{a_{t}}-e^{x-2z(t)}\right)dx\\
     & =\left(N_{t}-M_{t}\right)\tilde{a_{t}}+e^{-x}]_{M_{t}}^{z(t)}-e^{x-2z(t)}]_{z(t)}^{N_{t}}\\
     & =\left(N_{t}-M_{t}\right)\tilde{a_{t}}+e^{-z(t)}-e^{-M_{t}}-e^{N_{t}-2z(t)}+e^{-z(t)}\\
     & =\left(N_{t}-M_{t}-2\right)\tilde{a_{t}}+2e^{-z(t)}\\
    e^{z(t)} & =\left(N_{t}-M_{t}-2\right)e^{\frac{1}{2}\left(N_{t}-M_{t}\right)}+2
    \end{align*}
    
    This looks like a pain, but it can in principle be solved to find
    the value of $N_{t}-M_{t}\equiv2\tau_{t}$. Which will yield 
    \[
    \tau_{t}=W\left(\frac{-2+e^{z(t)}}{2e}\right)+1
    \]
    
    where $W$ is the product log, defined as the inverse of $W^{-1}(x)\equiv xe^{x}$.
    
    Then $M_{t}=z(0)+\frac{\bar{l}b}{4}t-\tau_{t}$and $N_{t}=z(0)+\frac{\bar{l}b}{4}t+\tau_{t}$.
    \[
    a(x,t)=\max\left[e^{-x},e^{x-2z(t)}\right]
    \]
    \[
    c(x,t)=\max\left[\frac{e^{-M_{t}}}{a(x,t)}-1,0\right]
    \]
    
    \[
    l(x,t)=\bar{l}c(x,t)a(x,t)
    \]
    \[
    y(x,t)=\bar{l}c(x,t)
    \]
    
    And because there is no savings and thus no smoothing over time, any
    set of prices is fine as long as $\tilde{P}(x,t)=\tilde{w}(t)\tilde{a}(x,t)$.
    For simplicity, we can set $w(t)=1$ and $\tilde{P}(x,t)=\tilde{a}(x,t)$.
    
    \section*{(c) Consider now a two country world in which the two countries are
    identical except in their endowments of labor and their initial technology
    levels. In particular, $z^{1}(0)>z^{2}(0).$ There is no borrowing
    or lending. Define an equilibrium. }
    
    (no transportation costs so prices are the same between countries.)
    
    A competitive equilibirum consists of prices $w_{1}(t),w_{2}(t),P(x,t)$;
    consumption functions $c_{1}(x,t),c_{2}(x,t)$, labor allocation functions
    $l_{1}(x,t)$,$l_{2}(x,t)$; and output such that $y_{1}(x,t)$,$y_{2}(x,t)$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Given prices, in each country $i$, consumers choose $c_{i}$ so that
    at each time $c_{i}$ maximizes 
    \[
    \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\rho t}\left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\log(c_{i}(x,t)+1)dx\right]dt
    \]
    \[
    \ni\int_{0}^{\infty}P(x,t)c_{i}(x,t)dx\leq w_{i}(t)\ \forall t
    \]
    \[
    c_{i}(x,t)\geq0
    \]
    \item Given prices, each firm chooses labor allocation $l_{i}(x,t)\geq0$
    to solve
    \[
    \max_{l_{i}(x,t)}P(x,t)\frac{l_{i}(x,t)}{a_{i}(x,t)}-w_{i}(t)l_{i}(x,t)
    \]
    \item Market Clears. For all x,i,t,:
    \[
    y_{i}(x,t)=\frac{l_{i}(x,t)}{a_{i}(x,t)}
    \]
    \[
    \bar{l_{i}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}l_{i}(x,t)dx
    \]
    \[
    \bar{l_{1}}c_{1}(x,t)+\bar{l_{2}}c_{2}(x,t)=\frac{l_{1}(x,t)}{a_{1}(x,t)}+\frac{l_{2}(x,t)}{a_{2}(x,t)}
    \]
    Perfectly competitive firms:
    \[
    P(x,t)=\min_{i}\left[w_{i}(t)a_{i}(x,t)\right]
    \]
    \item Non-negativity in prices
    \item Evolution of production function by LearningByDoing:
    \[
    \frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}a_{i}(x,t)}{a_{i}(x,t)}=\begin{cases}
    -\int_{0}^{\infty}b_{i}(v,t)l_{i}(v,t)dv & \text{if }a_{i}(x,t)>\bar{a}(x,t)\\
    0 & \text{if }a_{i}(x,t)=\bar{a}(x,t)

    \[
    b_{i}(v,t)=\begin{cases}
    b>0 & a_{i}(v,t)>\bar{a}(v,t)\\
    0 & a_{i}(v,t)=\bar{a}(v,t)
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section*{(d)Suppose that $z^{1}(t)>z^{2}(t).$ Explain carefully and illustrate
    two of the five qualitatively different possible equiblirbium configurations
    for production, consumption and trade at time $t.$ To make things
    easier, assume the $z(t)$s are sufficiently large such that good
    $0$ is not produced in equilibirum.}
    
    Consumers will only buy a good from the nation that produces it most
    cheaply. Let $w_{2}(t)$ be the numeraire, and let $W\equiv\frac{w_{1}}{w_{2}}=w_{1}$.
    Then the price of a good produced in country 1 is $Wa_{1}(x,t)$ and
    the price of a good produced in country 2 is $a_{2}(x,t)$.
    
    In each graph below, which plots good index vs price, $Wa_{1}(x,t)$
    is the solid blue line, $a_{2}(x,t)$ is the dotted orange line, The
    solid green line represents the maximum price that consumers from
    country 1 will pay for a good, and the dotted red line is the maximum
    price for consumers from country 2.
    
    For each graph, there is a region shaded with yellow horizontal lines,
    cooresponding to the consumption patterns of country 2 (area=$1$),
    and blue vertical lines for country 1 (area=$W$).
    
    Whenever a good is produced by both countries, it really means that
    that region of goods is produced by some combination of the two countries
    which is not specified in equilibirum. 
    
    $M_{i}^{j}\equiv$the leftmost point at which the price curve for
    country $j$ is equal to the maximum price paid by consumers in country
    $i$. Likewise, $N_{i}^{j}$ is the rightmost such point. 
    
    First some impossibilities:
    
    \subsubsection*{Impossibility 1: $W<1$}
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase-1}
    
    In this case, all goods are cheaper to produce in country 1, so none
    will be produced in country 2. But without lending, there is no way
    for the balance of trade to work out. This would mean, for example,
    that the total labor income of country 2 is $0$. But then country
    2 cannot possible inmport goods at nonnegative price. So this example
    contradicts the setup of the problem.
    
    \subsubsection*{Impossiblity 2: $W>e^{2(z_{1}(t)-z_{2}(t))}$}
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase-2}
    
    This results in all goods being cheaper in country 2, which also makes
    balanced trade impossible.
    
    \subsubsection*{Case 1: Equal wages}
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase1annotated}
    
    $W=1$ is the minimum possible $W$ with trade.
    
    Because wages are the same, the budget constraint is the same for
    each country, and consumption patterns will be identical. 
    
    Both countries consume goods in the range $[M,N^{1}]$
    
    Goods with $N^{1}\geq x>z_{2}(t)$ will be exclusively produced by
    country 1.
    
    Goods with $M\leq x\leq z_{2}(t)$ will be produced and by some combination
    of the two countries, which is not uniquely specified in equilibirum.
    
    \subsubsection*{Case 2: Maximum possible wage ratio}
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase2annotated}
    
    Here $W=e^{2(z_{1}(t)-z_{2}(t))}$.
    
    All goods with $x\in[M_{1}^{2},M_{2}^{2})$ will be produced exclusively
    by country 2, and consumed only by country 1.
    
    Goods with $x\in[M_{2}^{2},z_{1}(t))$ will be produced by country
    2, and consumed by both countries.
    
    Goods with $x\in\left[z_{1}(t),N_{2}\right]$ will be produced and
    consumed by both countries. 
    
    Goods with $x\in(N_{2},N_{1}]$will be produced by both countries
    and consumed only by country 1.
    
    \subsubsection*{Case 3-5: Intermediate wages}
    
    If $1<W<e^{2(z_{1}(t)-z_{2}(t))}$, then the two price functions will
    cross at exactly one point $v$ . Country 1 will not produce goods
    $x<v$ and country 2 will not produce goods $x>v$. 
    
    \subsubsection*{In case 3,}
    
    $P(v,t)<\tilde{P_{2}}$, and so this crossover good will be produced
    and consumed by both countries.
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase3annotated}
    
    Country 1 produces in the range $\left[M_{1}^{2},v\right]$
    
    Country 1 produces in the range $\left[v,N_{1}^{1}\right]$
    
    Country one consumes the range$\left[M_{1}^{2},N_{1}^{1}\right]$
    
    Country one consumes the range$\left[M_{2}^{2},N_{2}^{1}\right]$
    
    \subsubsection*{In Case 4,}
    
    $\tilde{P_{1}}>P(v,t)>\tilde{P_{2}}$and so good $v$ will be produced
    by both countries, but consumed only by country 1.
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase4annotated}
    
    In fact, there is now a gap around $v$ in the middle of country 2's
    range of consumed goods. Only country 2 consumes goods in this gap.
    
    \subsubsection*{In Case 5,}
    
    $P(v,t)>\tilde{P_{1}}$ and so neither country consumes good $v$
    
    \includegraphics{LbdCase5annotated}
    
    Consumption and production are like Case 3, except that there is now
    a region of goods around $v$ such that neither country consumes or
    produces in this region.
    
    \emph{(Note: All the other cases had graphs generated using actual
    parameters for $z_{1},z_{2},w_{1},w_{2}$, but I couldn't find nice
    looking parameters for case 5, so I just faked the graph.)}
    
    \section*{(e) Describe the dynamics of the model, explaining the crucial role
    played by the sizes of the two countries, $\bar{l}_{1}$ and $\bar{l_{2}}$.
    In particular, how much larger does $\bar{l_{2}}$ need to be so that
    $z_{2}(t)$ eventually passes $z_{1}(t)$? Describe the economic significance
    of this result.}
    
    For country 2 to eventually surpass country 1, it must be that $\bar{l_{2}}\geq\left(2+e^{2(z_{1}-z_{2})}\right)\bar{l}_{1}$.
    
    -
    
    The percentage change of $a_{i}$ for technology which isn't fully
    researched is $b\bar{l}_{i}\cdot$(portion of labor in country $i$
    allocated to producing hi tech goods.) $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}z_{i}(t)$
    is half of this rate. Thus the rate of change for $z_{i}$is proportional
    to the amount of $\bar{l_{i}}$ being used to produce goods $x>z_{i}$
    
    Note that in all 5 cases, Country 1 has a weakly greater share of
    its labor contributing to hi-tech fields. So for country 2 to catch
    up, it must have a larger population. 
    
    Also note that Case 1 can only happen if country 1 is larger, because
    the majority of the share of each country's consumption is produced
    in country 1. (The majority of two things adds up to more than the
    smaller of the two things.) For similar reasons, \textbf{Case 2 can
    only happen if country 2 is larger.}
    
    -
    
    Case 1 is the only case in which a country does not have increasing
    technology. In case 1, country 2 devotes all of their labor to fully-research
    technology, and so $z_{2}(t)$ remains static while $z_{1}(t)$ increases,
    until eventually the economy shifts into case 3 as country 1 exhausts
    their potential to shift labor into higher-tech industries without
    driving up wages.
    
    In all other cases, $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}z_{i}(t)$ is positive
    for both countries.
    
    -
    
    In Case 3-5, both countries technologically develop. When the relative
    size of the gap between tech levels in countries increase, it drives
    the equilibrium from case 3 to 4 to 5. And a decreasing gap drives
    things in the other direction. 
    
    \textbf{If Country 1 is bigger}, country 1 grows faster, and so the
    economy tends towards Case E over time. 
    
    \textbf{If the countries are of equal size,} then Case 3 has country
    1 growing relatively faster, driving the equilibrium to case 5. In
    case 5, each country devotes precisely half of its labor to producing
    hi-tech goods and thus both $z_{i}$increase the same. With the gap
    between tech levels constant, but tech levels inceasing, the relative
    size of the gap shrinks, driving the equilbirum to Case 4. 
    
    \textbf{If country 2 is bigger, }then Case 5 is quickly driven down
    into case 4. Cases 3 and 4 both exhibit widening gaps in technology.
    
    -
    
    So the only way for the gap between $z_{i}$s to shrink is for country
    2 to be bigger and the equilibrium to be in Case 2.
    
    Even in this case, for the tech gap to shrink, it must be that Country
    2 has a greater amount of labor in high tech industries.
    
    Country 1 uses all of it's labor on goods with $x>z_{2}$. This labor
    is equivalent to $w_{1}\bar{l_{1}}$ units of country 2's labor. When
    figuring out the share of labor used above the tech thresholds, we
    can, without loss of generality, presume that there is some $H$ such
    that country 1 does all production for $x>z_{2}+H$ and country two
    does all prodcution for $x<z_{2}+H$. By symmetry, country 2 allocates
    $w_{1}\bar{l_{1}}$ units of labor to $x<z_{2}-H$.
    
    \includegraphics{\string"rough proof\string".png}
    
    Then breaking country 2's labor up into chunks, we see that
    \[
    2A+2B+w_{1}\bar{l}_{1}=\bar{l_{2}}
    \]
    \[
    A+B=\frac{\bar{l_{2}}-w_{1}\bar{l}_{1}}{2}
    \]
    
    which is the amount of labor allocated by country 2 to hi tech goods.
    And in Case 2, $w_{1}=e^{2(z_{1}(t)-z_{2}(t))}$
    
    For $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}z_{2}(t)$>$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}z_{1}(t)$,
    it must be that 
    \[
    \frac{\bar{l_{2}}-e^{2(z_{1}(t)-z_{2}(t))}\bar{l}_{1}}{2}>\bar{l_{1}}
    \]
    \[
    \bar{l_{2}}>\left(2+e^{2(z_{1}(t)-z_{2}(t))}\right)\bar{l_{1}}
    \]
     
    
    - 
    
    The economic implication here is that if developing nations want to
    technologically advance they should become very large. Beacuse a nation
    in this model is defined as a region in which labor can freely move
    around, one strategy for development is to join unions with other
    nations to allow free movement of labor.
