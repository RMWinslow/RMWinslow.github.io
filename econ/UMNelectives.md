These are my notes on some of the undergraduate economics electives at UMN
and how they relate to topics discussed in Econ 3102. 


<!--

My goal is to help students find the electives that appeal to them by

## Brief Description on Common Prerequisites

- **Calculus II** (Math 1272 or equivalent) teaches you integral calculus. Integration is an important tool for understanding many different topics.
- **Linear Algebra** and Diff Eq (Math 2243). You've solved systems of equations before. This class extends and formalizes the concepts involved. Linear algebra also teaches you about matrix operations, which let you manipulate many numbers at once, and which are important for econometric techniques.
- **Multivariable Calculus** (Math 2263) takes the concepts and techniques from Calc I and II, and extends them to multiple dimensions. You've already seen a bit of this in your econ classes, whenever you take the partial derivative of a function.
- **Statistics** (Stat 4101 and 4102) teaches you about random distributions, and how to measure and summarize data. 
- Freshman Writing Practice

<!--
TODO: What is freshman writing practice?
I will list it as "writing" in the prereqs


Intro to stats is Stat 3011 3022
5101 and 5102 are mentioned, but only required for 8000 level courses. So I can ignore those here.

Maybe a note about the brief dicsussion of coorelations in class?
Integration is an important tool for understanding topics like uncertainty and inequality.
The underlying concepts are vital for discussing uncertainty and inequality. -->




<!--## Elective Courses Offered this Spring-->

<!--## Electives Related to Topics Covered in 3102-->

<!--## Some Notes Elective Offerings-->


First, some of the obvious connections:

We briefly discussed a Small Open Economy using chapters 16 and 17 of Williamson.
As you might expect, 
a course on **International Trade** (*4431W or 4438W for the advanced version*) will go into much more detail about related topics.
A course on **International Finance** (*4432W*) will have a lot of overlap with a course on international trade, but will focus more on the kinds of money-related concepts we talked about in chapter 17.

Likewise, a course on **Money and Banking** (*4721*) will go into much more detail about money and monetary policy.

In chapter 7 of our textbook, we contrasted the Solow Growth Model with a "Malthusian" model of the economy,
and used this comparison to discuss how the economy changed after 1800. 
**Economic Development** (*4331W*) goes into more detail about this very important bit of history
(arguably the *most* important bit of history)
and also touches on some of the barriers to development that were mentioned in chapter 8.

<!--I attach the syllabus. My guess would be very little overlap. We’re doing more econ history stuff and fewer models.-->


In 3102, we talked a little bit about inequalities *between* countries.
But another very important topic in economics,
and one which we weren't able to discuss in detail in 3102,
is the inequality found *within* a country.
**Poverty and Income Inequality** (*4341*) is a class which qualitatively explores inequality within the US, and the efforts to redress it.

While 4341 has the most focus on inequality,
there are many other upper level courses in which the topic of inequality heavily features.

**Labor Economics** (*4531 or 4538 for the advanced version*), for example, discusses wealth inequality and income inequality that can be found between households.
Labor Economics looks at the job search models we discussed with chapter 6 of Williamson, 
and also expounds upon the kind of intertemporal decisions we discussed with chapters 9 and 10.<!--, adding uncertainty into the mix.-->
In 3102, we discussed how households make decisions to prepare for their future, which they knew with certainty.
But in reality, households must make decisions to prepare for uncertain futures.
Will I lose my job? Will I get a raise? Etc.
These common concerns<!--Such shocks--> shape the decisions people make, 
and <!--such shocks--> are important for understanding the patterns of work, savings, and inequality.

<!--
If I had a lot of time, I could go through Lise's models one by one.
For example, 
https://digifesto.com/2019/11/09/notes-on-krussell-smith-1998-and-macroeconomic-theory/
 Krusell and Smith, 1998 “Income and wealth heterogeneity in the macroeconomy.”
has a model of inequality with different preference parameters. That's pretty easy to design a HW problem around.
-->


**Financial Economics** (*4751 or 4758 for the advanced version*) also heavily deals with decision making under uncertainty,
but with a focus on investment decisions and asset prices (as opposed to Labor Economics which deals with labor prices -- wages, that is).
We talked a lot about prices in 3102, but how were prices determined? Well, they were typically just whatever value allowed the market to clear.
But in financial contexts, its important to understand the details of the processes by which prices are determined.
Investment risk is another very important topic -- one which we only briefly saw in a simplified form in one our HW assignments in 3102 --
which is discussed in more detail in a Financial Economics course.

<!--
Regular reading of the business press (Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The
Economist, New York Times) is strongly recommended.
• Articles: Each chapter in Bailey’s textbook has a list of references. Other references
will be announced in class.
• Nobel Prize Committee 2013, “Understanding Asset Prices”.
• Hull, John Options, Futures and Other Derivatives Pearson Education, 10th (or ear-
lier) Edition, (useful for the 2nd part of the course).
(Bailey's Economics of Financial Markets textbook is very readable from what I've seen.)
-->

In fact, we made many simplifying assumptions in our models in 3102.
These simplifications made it easier to learn the models and work through the algebra,
but led us to gloss over some very important economic questions.

One of our simplifying assumptions in 3102 was that all our agents were competitive price takers.
We had a single "representative firm" which could be thought of as many very small firms, so small that their individual actions have no effect on the market. 
But what happens when a single firm or a group of firms *is* big enough to affect prices?
This often happens in the real-world, and **Industrial Organization** (*4631*) explores the implications this has for the economy.

Another very important economic question is the role of government policy. 
Sure, we talked about the government quite a bit in 3102, but government spending and taxes were, for the most part, exogenous in our models. 
The government itself wasn't an agent. 
But what if we do think of the government as having goals. 
What should those goals be? How can it accomplish them?
**Public Economics** (*4821*) explores these questions.


Finally, courses like **Economy of Latin America** (*4311*) or **The Chinese Economy** (*4317*)
discuss a broad array of topics which we talked about in 3102, with a focus on one particular region of the world.
If your favorite part of 3102 was the occasional tangent about some random bit of history, then consider taking one of these courses. 

-----

A few final caveats:
- Many of these courses cover a broader set of subjects than what is described here. I focused on the connections to 3102's material. 
- There are also some courses I didn't touch on in this list, such as Econometrics (which is like statistics with a focus on economic applications) or Game Theory (which is one of the most fascinating fields of economics, but has more connections to micro than to macro). 
- Another important thing to consider when choosing electives are the pre-requisites. Some of the courses require additional math classes, and are more numerically intense as a result. Other courses are writing intensive. It's a good idea to choose courses which match your preferred style of learning.
- This isn't the full course list, and course offerings vary by semester. Please consult the course catalog or talk to the [undergrad econ advisors](https://cla.umn.edu/economics/undergraduate/advising) for more information.
