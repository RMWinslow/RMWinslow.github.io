These are my notes on the undergraduate economics electives at UMN.

Students typically 
My goal is to help students find the electives that appeal to them by

## Brief Description on Common Prerequisites

- **Calculus II** (Math 1272 or equivalent) teaches you integral calculus. Integration is an important tool for understanding many different topics.
- **Linear Algebra** and Diff Eq (Math 2243). You've solved systems of equations before. This class extends and formalizes the concepts involved. Linear algebra also teaches you about matrix operations, which let you manipulate many numbers at once, and which are important for econometric techniques.
- **Multivariable Calculus** (Math 2263) takes the concepts and techniques from Calc I and II, and extends them to multiple dimensions. You've already seen a bit of this in your econ classes, whenever you take the partial derivative of a function.
- **Statistics** (Stat 4101 and 4102) teaches you about random distributions, and how to measure and summarize data. 
- Freshman Writing Practice


<!--
TODO: What is freshman writing practice?
I will list it as "writing" in the prereqs


Intro to stats is Stat 3011 3022
5101 and 5102 are mentioned, but only required for 8000 level courses. So I can ignore those here.

Maybe a note about the brief dicsussion of coorelations in class?
Integration is an important tool for understanding topics like uncertainty and inequality.
The underlying concepts are vital for discussing uncertainty and inequality. -->

But Lise's syllabus states

> I will assume that you are comfortable with micro concepts at the level of Econ 3101, 3102, such as the utility maximization problem and its related topics. I will also assume that you are comfortable with basic econometrics such as multivariate regression techniques as well as statistics at the level of Stat 3011. With regards to your math background, I will take as granted that you know how to work with calculus (derivatives). Students should be be willing to invest time in learning a computer programming language such as Matlab, R or Julia.
