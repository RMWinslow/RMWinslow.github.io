<h1>Trick Taking Games</h1>
<h2>Basic Rules of Trick-taking:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Each player is dealt a <b>hand</b> of cards.</li>
    <li>One suit is designated as the <b>trump suit</b>.</li>
    <li>During a <b>trick</b>, each player plays one card:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>The <b>lead player</b> plays any card from their hand. The suit of this card is now the <b>lead suit</b>.</li>
        <li>Then going around the table, every other player plays a card:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>If they have any cards in the lead suit, they must <i>follow suit</i> and play such a card.</li>
            <li>If they <i>don't</i> have any cards in the lead suit, they can play any card from their hand.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <li>At the end of each trick, find the highest ranked card:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Trump-suit cards are more highly ranked than any other card.</li>
        <li>Cards of the lead suit are more highly ranked than all non-trumps.</li>
        <li>Within each suit, cards are typically ranked AKQJT98765432, highest-to-lowest.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Whoever played the highest card <b>takes</b> all the cards from that trick and puts them in a stack in front of them. </li>
    <li>That player then leads the next trick.</li>
    <li>Tricks are played until everyone's hands are empty.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal in trick taking games varies. Sometimes you want to take as many tricks as possible. Sometimes you want to take as few as possible, or take a specific number of tricks. Or it could be that the specific cards <i>in</i> the tricks you take are what matters.</p>
