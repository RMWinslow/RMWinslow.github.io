I've taught Intermediate Macroeconomics for several years, lecturing to classes of up to 125 students.

I was awarded *Distinguished Instructor* in 2021 and 2022.

Since Fall of 2021, the course has switched to a large-lecture format.
In addition to delivering the main lectures, I also coordinate the discussion sections, and design the course material.
