If an entry is outlined, then it can be clicked on to expand into another list.<br />

An entry marked * indicates that the creature is extinct.<br />
An entry marked ** indicates that the creature is fictional.<br />

For the most part, the tree structure of this table adheres to the actual tree of life. But I moved a few critters around so that each subtable would contain a number of entries that can be rolled using a standard set of dice (4,6,8,10,12,20).<br />
<br />
I also completely ignored the actual taxonomy of fish because fish taxonomy has always confused me. Instead, I plugged in my random list of fish from <a href="https://paperelemental.blogspot.com/2018/08/d60-fish.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The table doesn't always drop all the way down to the species level in every clade. Instead, the maximum depth is based on LN's table or on my intuitive feeling for which animals are interesting. So the table includes subspecies of dogs, but lumps all ducks together.<br />
