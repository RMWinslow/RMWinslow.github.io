Depth of the tree is not dependent on species but rather on how interesting I think the distinctions are. Domestic dogs get their own subtable. All 3106 species of termite are lumped into a single entry.

Also, I've lumped all the various simple worm phyla together under one list. Yeah, yeah. Nematodes cover the entire world and live in every creature and there's hundreds of thousands of distinct species. But they all look the same to me.

Also, I have moved Moss Animals (related to molluscs) and Tunicates (our close cousins) into the the "Animals that don't look like animals" category.
