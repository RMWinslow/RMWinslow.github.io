                <b>Theorem</b><br>
                Let \(f_1(x)\), \(f_2(x)\), and \(g(x)\) be functions of \(x\) over the real interval \(X\equiv[A,B]\). Also let \(x_1,x_2\in[A,B]\).
                If:
                <ul style="margin-top: 0em">
                        <li>
                            For all \(x\in[0,B]\), \(f_2(x) \geq f_1(x)\),
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            \(f_1(x)\) is  increasing, \(g(x)\) is continuous,
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            \(f_2(A) \geq f_1(A) > g(A)\),
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For each \(i\),  and \(\forall x \in X, f_i(x)=g(x)\Leftrightarrow x=x_i\),
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                 Then \(x_2\geq x_1\)
            </div>

    <h6>Proof</h6>

    If \(x < x_1\), then \(f_1(x)>g(x)\).<br>
    &emsp;Let \(\dot{x} \equiv  \inf \left\{     x\in X \mid f_1(x) \leq g(x) \right\}  \). <br>
    &emsp;If \(x < \dot{x}\), then \(f_1(x)>g(x)\) . <br>
    &emsp;It must be that \(\dot{x}=x_1\). <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Note that \(\dot{x} > A\)<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; By the continuity of  \(g(x)\), there is an \(\varepsilon > 0\) such that \(g(x)< f_1(A)\) for all \(x \leq A+\varepsilon\).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; But \(f_1 \) is increasing, so for all \(x\leq A+\varepsilon\), \(f_1(x)\geq f_1(A)\).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Thus for all \(x\leq A+\varepsilon\), \(f_1(x) > g(x)\). So \(\dot{x} \geq A+\varepsilon\).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Note that if \(x < \dot{x}\), then \(f_1(\dot{x})\geq f_1(x) > g(x)\). <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;The set of \(x<\dot{x}\) is nonempty, so by the continuity of \(g(x)\), \(f_1(\dot{x})\geq g(\dot{x})\). <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;If \(f_1(\dot{x})> g(\dot{x})\), then a contradiction arises:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; By the continuity of  \(g(x)\), there is an \(\varepsilon > 0\) such that \( f_1(\dot{x}) > g(x)\) for all \(x\in B_\varepsilon [\dot{x}]\).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; But \(f_1 \) is increasing, so for all \(x\geq\dot{x}\), \(f_1(x)\geq f_1(\dot{x})\).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Thus for all \(x\leq \dot{x}+\varepsilon\), \(f_1(x)\geq f_1(\dot{x}) > g(x)\).<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And so \(\dot{x}\)  is not the infimum of \(\left\{     x\in X \mid f_1(x) \leq g(x) \right\}\). â†¯.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Therefore \(f_1(\dot{x})=g(\dot{x})\), which implies that \(\dot{x}=x_1\).<br>
    <!--&emsp;Therefore \(\nexists\, x < x_1\) such that \(f_1(x)\leq g(x)\).<br>-->
    So if \(x < x_1\) then \(f_2(x)\geq f_1(x) > g(x)\).<br>
    And \(f_2(x_2)=g(x_2)\), so by contrapositive, \(x_2 \geq x_1\). <br>



    <h6>But also, I mean, just look at it.</h6>

    <table>
        <col><col width="169px">
        <tr> <td> If you shine a beam (\(g\)) up at two continuous barriers, and one barrier (\(f_1\)) is always on top of the other (\(f_2\)), then the beam will strike the barrier on the bottom first.</td><td>  <img src="laser1.png" width="169px"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>To strike the top barrier first, the beam has to make it through a gap in the bottom barrier without striking it. This kind of gap doesn't work because \(f_1\) is increasing. </td><td><img src="laser2.png"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>And this kind of gap doesn't work because to fly through it, the beam would have to travel to the left, which it can't do because it's a continuous function of \(x\). Even if we wiggle the beam a bit, it can't go left. So even if we allow for discontinuities, the beam can't get through. </td><td><img src="laser3.png"></td></tr>
