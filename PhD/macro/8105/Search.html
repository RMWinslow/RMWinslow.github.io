<h2>Tim's Favorite Search Problem</h2>
<h5>Setup:</h5>

The agent has preferences given by \[ \sum_{t}\beta^t c_t \]

<ul>
	<li>
		If the agent is unemployed at the start of the period (state \( S^U \)), then a random wage offer \(w\) is drawn from the fixed distribution \(F(w)\), which has support \([0,B]\). The agent can choose to accept or reject the offer.
		<ul>
			<li>If they accept, they earn income \(w\), and then enter the next period employed at wage \(w\).</li>
			<li>If they reject, they earn fixed income \(b\), and then enter the next period unemployed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		If the agent is employed at the start of the period with wage \(w\) (state \(S^E(w)\)), they earn income \(w\), and then enter the next period employed with wage \(w\). Jobs can never be lost.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This system can be summarized by the following diagram. (<a href="../FlowchartKey.html">key</a>)</p>

<img src="KehoeSearchLabels.png" alt="Flowchart for a simple job search with no firing.">

The loop of being employed is on the right, and the loop of searching for a job is on the left. \(V(w)\) is the present value of having offer \(w\) in hand. \(V^U\) is the present value of starting a period unemployed.




<h5>Characterizing the Decision Rule</h5>

Note that per-period utility flow is bounded, and so with discounting, all present values are bounded as well.

\[V^R = b +\beta V^U\]
\[V^U = E[V(w)] \]
\[V(w) = \max \left\{V^A (w),V^R\right\} \]
\[ V^A (w) = V^E (w) = w + \beta V^E (w) = {w \over 1-\beta} \]

It is optimal to accept an offer iff \({w \over 1-\beta}\geq V^R\). The LHS is strictly increasing in \(w\), and the RHS is constant, though we don't know it yet. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be a reservation wage \(\bar{w}\) such that \({\bar{w} \over 1-\beta}= V^R\) and it is optimal to accept an offer iff \(w\geq\bar{w}\). Therefore:

\[ V^U = E\left[V(w)\right] = \Pr(w<\bar{w})V^R + \Pr(w\geq\bar{w})E\left[{w \over 1-\beta}\mid w\geq\bar{w}\right] \]

\[ {\bar{w} \over 1-\beta} = V^R = b +\beta V^U = b + \beta F(\bar{w}){\bar{w} \over 1-\beta} +\beta \int_{\bar{w}}^{B} {w \over 1-\beta} f(w) dw  \]

The above function characterizes the reservation wage for given \(b\) and \(F\). Rearranging:
\[ 0 = \bar{w}\left({1-\beta F(\bar{w}) \over 1-\beta}\right) -b - \beta \int_{\bar{w}}^{B} {w \over 1-\beta} f(w) dw \]

You can verify that this has only one solution by evaluating the right-hand side as a continuous function of \(\bar{w}\). The RHS is negative at \(\bar{w}=0\), positive at \(\bar{w}=B\), and the derivative is strictly positive over \((0,B)\).







<h5> Comparative Statics: Increasing Unemployment Benefits \(b\).</h5>

<p><i>Consider two economies with different unemployment benefits \(b_1\) and \(b_2\), but that are otherwise identical. </i></p>

Let \(b_2 > b_1\). Define:
\[ \hat{b}(x) \equiv x\left({1-\beta F(x) \over 1-\beta}\right) - \beta \int_{x}^{B} {w \over 1-\beta} f(w) dw \]

From above, we know that \(b_i = \hat{b}(\bar{w_i})\). Taking the derivative, 
\[ \hat{b}'(x) = \left({1-\beta F(x) \over 1-\beta}\right) - x{\beta\over 1-\beta}f(x) - {\beta\over 1-\beta} (-xf(x)) = \left({1-\beta F(x) \over 1-\beta}\right) > 0\]

So because \(\hat{b}(x)\) is continuous and strictly increasing, \(b_2>b_1 \implies \hat{b}(\bar{w_2})>\hat{b}(\bar{w_1}) \implies \bar{w_2} > \bar{w_1} \)<br><br><br><br>



<p>More intuitively, but a bit less rigourously, let \(V^U_i\) be the present value of starting a period unemployed in economy \(i\). We know that \(V^E(\bar{w_i})=b_i+V^U_i\) and so \(b_i=V^E(\bar{w_i})-V^U_i\)</p>

Note that \(V_2^U \geq V_1^U\). If the agents in each economy follow the same strategy, and witness the same sequence of random events, then the agent in economy 2 will always have per-period income at least as high as the agent in economy 1. So it can't possibly be that \(V_2^U < V_1^U\). And so:

\[0>b_2-b_1=V^E(\bar{w_2})-V^E(\bar{w_1})-V^U_2+V^U_1 \geq V^E(\bar{w_2})-V^E(\bar{w_1})=({1 \over 1-\beta})(\bar{w_2}-\bar{w_1})\]	
\[\bar{w_2}>\bar{w_1}\]


<h5>Mean Preserving Spread</h5>


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


Intuitively, \(b=V^E(\bar{w})-\beta V^U\), and \(\hat{b}'(x)\) is the difference between <b>Accepting an offer of x</b> and <b>The discounted value of </b>


Intuitively, the present value of accepting any given job offer doesn't change when \(b\) changes.
