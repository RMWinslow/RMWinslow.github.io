Approach:
    -Show that the profit function is a multiple of kapital input. Call this multiple R_k(z,w)
    -Give a label to the natural borrowing limit
    -rewrite consumer problem to take advantage of these substitutions
    -make assumptions on optimum and verfiy them somehow


The Recursive equilibirum, given intital asset distribution, is
    -value function
    -policy functions
    -pricing kernels
    -beliefs about the evolution of the overall asset distribution
such that
    -v achieves the maximum in the the consumer's FE, given beliefs
    -the policy functions solve the same FE
    -markets clear
    -beliefs are accurate (how?!)


If time, rewrite problem by putting R on the left hand side
