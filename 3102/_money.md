> Note: Prior to 2008, when there were limited reserves in the banking system, the Fed used open market operations to move the federal funds rate higher and lower, but now the Fed has chosen to operate with ample reserves and so uses its administered rates (interest rate on reserve balances rate, ON RRP offering rate, and discount rate) to steer the federal funds rate into the target range.

Why is IORB slightly higher than FFR? 
Don't have the intuition there.
