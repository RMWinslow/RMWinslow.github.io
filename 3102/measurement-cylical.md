The Assumption is that the data can be decomposed like so:

$$\text{data} = \text{trend} + \text{seasonal} + \text{cyclical}$$

- **Trend** = smoothed out so we only see long-term patterns
- **Seasonal** component = predictable fluctations that happen on a yearly cycle
    - Examples:
        - Farming: weather affects output of crops (harvest) and determines when you want to hire labor to work on those fields
        - Holidays: People consume more at Christmas time, they consume more travel services if everyone is visiting their family at the same time, etc.
    - For annual data, seasonal adjustment doesn’t do anything.
- **Cyclical** component = The part of the data which can’t be explained by long-term patterns and which doesn’t follow some consistent predictable pattern.

## The Boom and Bust Cycle

Peak
: Economic activity reaches a high point and begins to decline.

Trough
: Economic activity reaches a low point and begins to increase again.

Recession
: Going from a Peak to a Trough. A significant drop in economic activity that affects the entire economy.

Boom/Expansion
: Going from a trough to a peak. Happens whenever there isn’t a recession.



## Additional Terms

Procyclical
: If the cyclical component of a variable is positively correlated with the cyclical component of GDP, then we say that this variable is Procyclical

Countercyclical
: If the cyclical component of a variable is negatively correlated with the cyclical component of GDP, then we say that this variable is Countercyclical

Acyclical
: If no correlation between cyclical component of a variable and the cyclical component of GDP, then the variable is Acyclical

Lagging
: Deviations from trend move with GDP but the peaks and troughs happen slightly after the peaks and troughs in GDP

Leading
: Deviations from trend move with GDP but the peaks and troughs happen slightly before the peaks and troughs in GDP

Coincident
: Deviations from trend move with GDP, but are neither leading nor lagging.



## Summary of Business Cycle Facts

|  | Cyclicality | Lead/Lag | Variation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Consumption | Procyclical | Coincident | Smaller than GDP's |
| Investment | Procyclical | Coincident | Larger than GDP's |
| Employment | Procyclical | Lagging | Smaller than GDP's |
| Real Wage | Procyclical | ? | ? |
| Average Labor Productivity | Procyclical | Coincident | Smaller than GDP's |
