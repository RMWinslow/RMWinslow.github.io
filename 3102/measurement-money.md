For more details, take a look at this page from the Federal Reserve: 
[Money Stock Measures - H.6 Release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm)

The Federal Reserve also use to publish a measure called M3,
but [decided that it wasn't worth the effort](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/discm3.htm).

### How does the government actually change the money supply?

- Helicopter money: Increase the money money supply by decreasing taxes or equivalently increasing transfers.
- Seignorage: Government prints money to buy stuff.
- Open market operations: Increase money supply by decreasing government debt (ie by purchasing bonds).
  - Quantitative Easing: Like Open Market Operations, but with longer-term assets.

(But note that the Federal Reserve doesn't use the Money Supply as their main policy target.
Rather than using OMO to set the money supply to some specific amount,
the Fed has interest rate targets, and uses money-supply affecting policy 
as a tool to achieve those interest-rate targets.
