> Net exports in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) corresponds to
the measure “balance on goods and services”—commonly referred to as the “trade
deficit” (when imports exceeds exports) or the “trade surplus” (when exports exceeds
imports)—in the international transactions (or balance of payments) accounts (ITAs),
also produced by BEA.
1 The two measures are very similar, but they differ in coverage,
definitions, and in timing of revisions (see the section “Adjustments and other
differences between the NIPA and ITA estimates). Net exports is also a component of the
“balance on current account,” a measure in both the ITAs and the NIPAs that also
includes receipts and payments of income and receipts and payments of current taxes,
contributions for government social insurance, and transfers.
