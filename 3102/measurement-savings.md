Private Disposable Income 
: How much households have to spend, in aggregate.

$$Y_d = \textcolor{6c71c4}{Y} + \textcolor{#268bd2}{NFP} + \textcolor{#dc322f}{TR} + \textcolor{#859900}{INT} - \textcolor{#b58900}{T}$$

<span style="color:">Private Disposable Income</span> = 
<span style="color:#6c71c4">Output</span> + 
<span style="color:#268bd2">Net factor payments</span> + 
<span style="color:#dc322f">Net transfers from the government to private individuals</span> + 
<span style="color:#859900">Interest on government debt held by individuals </span> - 
<span style="color:#b58900">Taxes</span>.

Government Savings 
: All the money the government collects - the money that they spend

$$S_g = \textcolor{#b58900}{T} - \left(  \textcolor{#2aa198}{G} + \textcolor{#dc322f}{TR} + \textcolor{#859900}{INT}     \right) $$

<span style="color:">Government Savings</span> = 
<span style="color:#2aa198">Government Expenditures</span> - 
<span style="color:#b58900">Taxes</span> - 
<span style="color:#dc322f">Net transfers from the government to private individuals</span> - 
<span style="color:#859900">Interest on government debt held by individuals </span>.


### National Savings

$$
\begin{align*}
S	&=S_{p}+S_{g} \\
	&=\left(Y+NFP+TR+INT-T-C\right)+\left(T-G-TR-INT\right)\\
	&=\left(Y-C-G\right)+NFP\\
	&=I+NX+NFP\\
	&=I+CA\\
\end{align*}
