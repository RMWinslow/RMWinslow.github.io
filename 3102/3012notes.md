Below are some of my teaching notes for Econ 3102, Intermediate Macroeconomics.

I've prepared these notes for several reasons:
- As a teaching aide, to highlight and outline points I wish to make during lectures.
- As a study aide. The textbook we use for the course[^textbook] covers a similar range of material, but it can often be helpful for students to see the same material presented several different ways.
- To collect some resources and links which are relevant to the lecture material. I often like to pull up a graph from FRED or similar in the middle of a lecture, and it's handy to have those links collected together.

[^textbook]: Williamson, Stephen D. “Macroeconomics, 6th.” (2018)

If you are one of my students and have come across this page,
please be aware that all material here is also posted on Canvas.

Or maybe it would be good to put EG measurement under a header. Hrrm.
Oh well, I'll do it as above for now and can change things around later.
