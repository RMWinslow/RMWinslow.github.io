## Exchange Rate Definitions

Exchange Rates

Nominal Exchange Rate: The price of a unit of currency, measured in terms of another currency.

When you buy a loaf of bread, the price of the bread is for example2\frac{dollars}{loaf}

The store is at the same time buying dollar bills using bread, at a price of \frac{1}{2}\frac{loafs}{dollar}

So if you have US Dollars and you exchange them for Chinese Yuan (Buying Yuan using Dollars at a price of \frac{1}{7}\frac{dollars}{yuan})

Likewise, you exchange CNY for USD, you are buying dollars at a price of 7\frac{yuan}{dollars}

Real Exchange Rate: Exchange rate adjusted for local price differences.

If e is the nominal exchange rate and RER is the real exchange rate, thenRER=e\frac{P^{*}}{P}

<!--Example - Big Mac Index: -->

Purchasing Power Parity: PPP is the condition that the RER happens to be 1, meaning an amount of each currency that can buy the same goods is equivalent in value.$1=RER=e\frac{P^{*}}{P}P=eP^{*}$

Exchange Rate Regimes:

In our model, if PPP holds, $M_{d}=PL=eP^{*}L$

- Floating/Flexible Exchange Rate: Don't worry about it. Let the exchange rate move up and down in response to market forces.
    - Use monetary policy to adjust the M_{s} to keep P stable (and to counteract business cycle shocks).
        - If a shock increase $P$, (by decrease liquidity demand), decrease the money supply
        - If a shock decreases $P$, (by increasing liquidity demand), increase the money supply
    - Don't use monetary policy to influence the exchange rate:
        - If a shock increases $P^{*}$, then don't respond. Keep $$ stable, which means (assuming PPP holds, so $P=eP^{*}$), the exchange rate must fall.
        - If a shock decreases $P^{*}$, then don't respond. Keep $P$ stable, which means (assuming PPP holds, so $P=eP^{*}$), the exchange rate must rise.
- Fixed Exchange Rate: 
    - Use monetary policy to keep the nominal exchange rate e stable
        - If $P$ changes but $P^{*}$ does not, we can't stabilize $P$ because that would change $e$.
    - But this means that your domestic price level is now exposed to shocks to the foreign price level.
        - If a shock increases $P^{*}$, then (assuming PPP holds, so $P=eP^{*}$), the domestic price level $P$ must also increase.
        - If a shock decreases $P^{*}$, then (assuming PPP holds, so $P=eP^{*}$), the domestic price level $P$ must also decrease.
- Dollarization: Use another country's currency.
