<h1>Type to Play Music.</h1>

<p>There are lots of online keyboard pianos out there, but I wanted one where:
<ol>
	<li>The sounds are pure tones - sine waves - so I can play around with harmonics.
	<li>The sounds are sustained as long as the key is held down. 
	<li>The notes are laid out in a way that "feels right" on a qwerty keyboard, instead of just trying to copy the layout of a piano.
</ol>
</p>

<p>Keyboard svg modified from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ANSI_US_QWERTY_(Windows)_Enter_Return.svg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Frequencies are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation#Five-limit_tuning">5-prime-limit tuning.</a> Shifting over a column multiplies frequency by either 4/3 (perfect fourth) or 3/2 (Perfect fifth), alternating. Shifting two columns goes up an octave. Shifting down a row multiplies frequency by 9/8 (Major Tone) or 10/9 (Minor Tone). Open the dev console if you want to see a log of all the keypresses and notes.</p>

<p>This works best in Chrome, using a keyboard with n-key rollover.</p>

<p>Also, here are a few other layouts:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="tones-rows-flipped">An arrangement similar to the above, but with all twelve notes.</a>
	<li><a href="tones-rows">"", but with the B note on the top row.</a>
	<li><a href="tones-wicki">Isomorphic layout based on the Wicki-Hayden Musical Note Layout.</a>
	<li><a href="tones-wicki2">Wicki-Hayden with different tuning.</a>
	<!--<li><a href="tones-up">The above layout but flipped upside-down.</a>-->
	<li><a href="tones-tonnetz">Euler's Tone Net</a>
</ol>

<script>
//This script tries to build a keyboard that does a few things differently than what you can find online:
//- Firstly, It's designed directly as a kayboard kayboard, not trying to mimic a piano's layout
//- Secondly, the sounds are pure tones which are sustained as long as the key is held. Not glitchy midis.
//- Most keys on top rows (only b on the bottom), assuming you're in C major

//Here are some songs to play around with: https://noobnotes.net/browse/browse-songs-in-c-major/

//Praise be to http://marcgg.com/blog/2016/11/01/javascript-audio/
//Problems to fix:
//			[ ] fadeout is broken in firefox
//			[x] harmonics are clicky in chrome. Need to limit sound to fix that.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//These are used to only start the tone when the key is first pressed.
//Without these, holding a key will generate multiple osicillators.
keyflags = {}

// create web audio api context
var AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;
var ctx = new AudioContext();

//Here's the buckets where we hold onto the sounds.
oscillators = {};
gains = {};

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//And here's the stuff that tells us what the frequency for each key is supposed to be.
//It also, incidentally, implicitly defines which keys to ignore.
//Change the tuning by changing the values of the row and column multipliers
var principle = 110;

//This setup is based on a 5-limit Just tuning. Which means all the ratios have factors of 3,4, or 5
//See here for more info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-limit_tuning
//(Really wish I had found that article before working out the fractions by hand)
//CDEFGAB, and F# are all represented. The F# may seem out of place, but it completes several patterns.
//Shifting over a column increases frequency by either 4/3 (perfect fourth) or 3/2 (Perfect fifth), alternating. (Shifting two cols doubles frequency)
//Shifting down a row increases frequency by 9/8 (Major Tone) or 10/9 (Minor Tone)
//C can be found on any odd digit key.
//As a sidenote, if you deleted the first entry from the colMult list, then KeyA would be an A note and KeyB will be a B note. Neat!
//You cold also flip it upside down and have the KeyC, KeyD, and KeyE be mapped to notes C D and E, respectively. But I've tried that; it's uncomfortable to play.
