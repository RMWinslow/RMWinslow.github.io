<h1>Type to Play Music</h1>

<h2>Euler'z Tone Net</h2>

<p>This layout is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz">Euler's Tonnetz.</a> Shifting by one column multiplies frequency by 2^(4/12). Shifting down a row multiples frequency by 2^(4/12)</p>

<p>This works best in Chrome, using a qwerty keyboard with n-key rollover.</p>

//This script tries to build a keyboard that does a few things differently than what you can find online:
//- Firstly, It's designed directly as a kayboard kayboard, not trying to mimic a piano's layout
//- Secondly, the sounds are pure tones which are sustained as long as the key is held. Not glitchy midis.
//- Most keys on top rows (only b on the bottom), assuming you're in C major

//Here are some songs to play around with: https://noobnotes.net/browse/browse-songs-in-c-major/

//Praise be to http://marcgg.com/blog/2016/11/01/javascript-audio/
//Problems to fix:
//			[ ] fadeout is broken in firefox
//			[x] harmonics are clicky in chrome. Need to limit sound to fix that.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//These are used to only start the tone when the key is first pressed.
//Without these, holding a key will generate multiple osicillators.
keyflags = {}

// create web audio api context
var AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;
var ctx = new AudioContext();

//Here's the buckets where we hold onto the sounds.
oscillators = {};
gains = {};

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//And here's the stuff that tells us what the frequency for each key is supposed to be.
//It also, incidentally, implicitly defines which keys to ignore.
//Change the tuning by changing the values of the row and column multipliers
var principle = 220;

//This setup is based on a 5-limit Just tuning. Which means all the ratios have factors of 3,4, or 5
//See here for more info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-limit_tuning
//(Really wish I had found that article before working out the fractions by hand)
//CDEFGAB, and F# are all represented. The F# may seem out of place, but it completes several patterns.
//Shifting over a column increases frequency by either 4/3 (perfect fourth) or 3/2 (Perfect fifth), alternating. (Shifting two cols doubles frequency)
//Shifting down a row increases frequency by 9/8 (Major Tone) or 10/9 (Minor Tone)
//C can be found on any odd digit key.
//As a sidenote, if you deleted the first entry from the colMult list, then KeyA would be an A note and KeyB will be a B note. Neat!
//You cold also flip it upside down and have the KeyC, KeyD, and KeyE be mapped to notes C D and E, respectively. But I've tried that; it's uncomfortable to play.

//want to make one where each 12 note octave is 3 columns on keyboard.
//also want t make one using just intonation where the CDE   FGA   are on the top two rows, 
//within an octave, colunns change 2 boops, rows 1 and 2 change 5 boops
//and then on bottom two rows do B=Cb Db Eb    and   Gb  Ab  Bb
//equiv,  B C# D#  and F# G# A#
//These bottom two rows shift cols by 2 boops and rows by 7 (flip to make it 5)
//and since b is last, we need need to offset the b row by 2 so it comes in under the A#
//maybe put the F# row on top? Yeeah B under the A 

//Or one where those triple dhords are in a row? tonnetz. Row gaps go 435435435
//Home row is C E G CEG
//another row is FADFAD
//B in same col as the G and D
//bu then left over is B G# D#  and  F# A# C#
//(not possible just sticking to majors)

//could also just straight up nab the tonnetz and put that on the keyboard,

//could equivalently use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_table_note_layout
//which is shear mapping of tonnetz
