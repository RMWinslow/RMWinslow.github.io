### Abstract

> Whether a disease outbreak dies out early or expands into a full blown-
epidemic depends not only on the average spread of disease, but also on the
variation between individuals in how likely they are to spread the disease
to others. The source of this variation is, in part, due to the fact that
different people have differing levels of contact with others. In a behavioral
model in which people choose the level of contact they have with others
in response to new of disease outbreak, highly connected people respond
qualitatively different from people with few social connections. When
transmissibility is high, highly connected people can become fatalistic.
