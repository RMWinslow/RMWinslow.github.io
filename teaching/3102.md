I've taught Intermediate Macroeconomics Summer 2019 - Spring 2023, Twelve semesters in total.

I was awarded *Distinguished Instructor* by the department in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Since Fall of 2021, the course has switched to a large-lecture format.
In addition to delivering the main lectures to classes of 100+ students, 
I also coordinate the discussion sections, and design the course material.
