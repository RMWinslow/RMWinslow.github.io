I taught Intermediate Macroeconomics at UMN from Summer 2019 - Spring 2023, Twelve semesters in total.

I was awarded *Distinguished Instructor* by the department in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

Starting in Fall of 2021, the course switched to a large-lecture format.
In addition to delivering the main lectures to classes of 100+ students, 
I also coordinated the discussion sections, and designed the course material.
