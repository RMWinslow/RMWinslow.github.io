<!-- This assignment is adapted in-part from material by Terry J. Fitzgerald. -->

This assignment is under construction.


## Instructions

Each problem in this assignment asks you to work with data and/or answer one or more reflection questions about the data.
Each chart you produce *must* be clearly labeled, self-contained, and easy to read. 
Your answers to the reflection questions should be succint and insightful. 
When writing your answers, imagine that you are preparing a report for your very busy, non-economist, manager.

You must submit one report (preferable in PDF format) to D2L, 
which contains all of your charts and your answers to the questions.
Once again, your analysis and charts must be self-contained and clearly labeled. 

You are allowed to work with others on this assignment, but:
- Be sure to include attribution at the top of your submission. If someone helped you create a document, their name should be somewhere on the document.
- Submitted work should be your own. *(Charts will naturally look similar. Thatâ€™s fine.)*
