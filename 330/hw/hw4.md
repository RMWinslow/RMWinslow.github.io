<!-- TODO: I WANT SOME ALGEBRA -->

<!-- This assignment is adapted in-part from material by Terry J. Fitzgerald. -->

This assignment is under construction.

<!-- 
## Instructions

Each problem in this assignment asks you to work with data and/or answer one or more reflection questions about the data.
Each chart you produce *must* be clearly labeled, self-contained, and easy to read. 
Your answers to the reflection questions should be succint and insightful. 
When writing your answers, imagine that you are preparing a report for your very busy, non-economist, manager.

You must submit one report (preferable in PDF format) to D2L, 
which contains all of your charts and your answers to the questions.
Once again, your analysis and charts must be self-contained and clearly labeled. 

You are allowed to work with others on this assignment, but:
- Be sure to include attribution at the top of your submission. If someone helped you create a document, their name should be somewhere on the document.
- Submitted work should be your own. *(Charts will naturally look similar. That’s fine.)* -->


## Problem 1: 

Calculate the **Present Value**, to the nearest dollar, for each of the following cash flows.
Assume a **10% interest rate** for each.
Show your work. (The relevant formulas are in chapter 4 of Mishkin)

1. 1100 dollars next year, 1210 dollars two years from now, and 1331 dollars three years from now.
2. 7400 dollars, 21 years from now.
3. 2000 dollars every year, forever.
4. 2000 dollars every year, for 7 years

<!-- 
Sum from 1 to infinity of 1/(1+x) = 1/x if |x| < 1

100 year maturity, 7.55% interest rate

-->


## Problem 2: 

Calculate the **Yield to Maturity** for each of the following assets.
Show your work, and verify that the present value of future payments equals the initial price you paid.

1. You pay 1000 dollars today and recieve 1340 dollars six years from now.
2. You pay 1000 dollars today. You recieve 100 dollars every year for the next nine years. Then ten years from now, you recieve 1100 dollars.

<!-- 2. You pay 300,000 dollars today and recieve 60,000 dollars every year for the next ten years. -->


## Problem 3:

Suppose a Discount Bond promises 2000 dollars in one year's time.
For each of the following prices for this bond, calculate the interest rate (yield to maturity):
2000 dollars, 1900 dollars, 1800 dollars, 1700 dollars, 1600 dollars.
Show your work.

## Problem 4:

Suppose the state of South Dakota reduces state taxes without reducing state spending, and has a state-level budget deficit as a result. 
In about 20-30 words, describe what this might do to the supply and demand for South Dakota Municipal bonds, and why.

Attach a sketch of this shock to your homework, ala the depictions of shocks in Mishkin ch5. (I would prefer that you insert it into your submission file, if possible.) 

What do you expect would happen to equilibrium Price, Interest Rate, and Quantity sold for this bond?

<!-- Either S increase OR supply increase + demand decrease -->



<!-- 
## Problem 5:
 I want something related to yeild curves but maybe I'll put it off to the next homework. 
 -->

## Mishkin HW suggestions

### Chapter 4

various YTM questions
    property taxes
    perpetuity
    capital gain
    lots of stuff
Get data in 4 year auto loan, borrow 20k, pay 4 fixed payments. What will payments be?
Take a look at Treasury Inflation Indexed Securities (FRED: DGS5 vs DFII5, likewise for 7,10,20,30)
    Went negative in 2008. Why?
    My suggestion: Compare to Real interest rate calculate another way?

Maybe the previous edition had them merged?
