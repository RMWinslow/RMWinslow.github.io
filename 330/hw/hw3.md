<!-- This assignment is adapted in-part from material by Terry J. Fitzgerald. -->

This assignment is under construction.


## Instructions

Each problem in this assignment asks you to work with data and/or answer one or more reflection questions about the data.
Each chart you produce *must* be clearly labeled, self-contained, and easy to read. 
Your answers to the reflection questions should be succint and insightful. 
When writing your answers, imagine that you are preparing a report for your very busy, non-economist, manager.

You must submit one report (preferable in PDF format) to D2L, 
which contains all of your charts and your answers to the questions.
Once again, your analysis and charts must be self-contained and clearly labeled. 

You are allowed to work with others on this assignment, but:
- Be sure to include attribution at the top of your submission. If someone helped you create a document, their name should be somewhere on the document.
- Submitted work should be your own. *(Charts will naturally look similar. That’s fine.)*


## Problems (WIP, brainstorming)

1. Plot the velocity of money. (Nominal GDP divided by the M2 money supply.)

<!-- 
Possible future variant: redo with divisia m2 money aggregate.

> Long-time readers will recall that I argued that inflation was entirely predictable using a simple forecasting model that included only two variables: inflation and the growth rate of the money supply (as measured by Divisia M2). This forecasting model suggested that, using only data available as of the end of 2020 that we should expect rising rates of inflation throughout 2021. In addition, the model predicted, using only data through 2021 that the U.S. would experience persistently high rates of inflation throughout 2022. That model’s predictions turned out to be quite accurate, despite its simplicity.

Another nice quote.
> who is responsible for the increase in the price. The answer is clearly the consumers whose demand has risen. They are the ones who set in motion the process by which prices increased. Yet, if we were to ask meat packer-suppliers why prices have gone up, they will blame the cost of cattle. If we ask the butcher why prices have gone up, he will blame the rising prices of the meat packer-suppliers.

That substack article also has a paper I want to read about the link between fiscal policy and inflation: https://www.nber.org/papers/w31838

It links to the following article I want to read, but I can't access it without downloading the app.

justification of viewing inflation as decline in purchasing power,
explanation of "medium of account" term,
+ argument that the monetary base actually is the important thing here
> This helps us to understand, for example, why we didn’t experience the high rates of inflation that were predicted following the Fed’s large expansion of its balance sheet in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet while also paying interest on reserves. This payment of interest on reserves increased the demand for reserves at precisely the same time that it was creating reserves. Supply increases. Demand increases. Those two effects offset one another.
+ defense of money multiplier ( see comments ) 
( excess demand for base money -> declining money multiplier -> decline in M2? )


Here's another great article:
https://www.economicforces.xyz/p/central-banks-and-fiscal-policy?utm_source=publication-search
"Some people might talk about central banking in terms of the interest rate or the money supply or the inflation rate, but fundamentally, it is about the supply and demand for liquidity."

https://www.economicforces.xyz/p/no-doge-checks-wouldnt-cause-inflation?utm_source=publication-search
>With that as a backdrop, we can get a sense of why people might think that a DOGE dividend would be inflationary. For example, consider the typical environment in which the government gives out checks. Ordinarily this is done during recessions or in anticipation of a coming recession. In that environment, monetary policy tends to shift towards a more expansionary stance. The mechanics of sending out checks is as follows. The U.S. Treasury department issues bonds. The proceeds of those bonds are used to give out checks to the American taxpayer. The Federal Reserve, in its expansionary stance, is purchasing U.S. Treasury securities on the open market. As a result, what is effectively happening is that these checks are financed by an increase in base money.
> An excess supply of money manifests in higher levels of nominal spending. An excess demand for money results in lower levels of nominal spending. Thus, the central bank can adjust the money supply to meet money demand by targeting a stable path for nominal spending. The central bank could have a target of constant nominal spending or it could have a target of constant growth in nominal spending. For example, during the period known as the Great Moderation, nominal spending growth was remarkably constant at around 5 percent per year.



https://www.economicforces.xyz/p/what-theory-does-and-does-not-say?utm_source=publication-search
> If the growth rate of the money supply was entirely random, then firms would see an increase in the demand for their product. Unsure of whether this increase in demand was caused by an increase in the demand for their particular product or due to an increase in the money supply, firms would increase both output and prices. This would generate a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. However, if the change in the money supply was anticipated, the policy would not be effective at reducing unemployment at all. In fact, the higher expected rate of inflation would be counterproductive.
> This point was especially important given the evidence. The early, robust negative empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment was based on sample periods in which the monetary regime was the gold standard.

Something related to rates.
Ideas from Terry:
- Plot 10 yr rate minus 2 year rate for treasury constant maturity - relate spread to recessions
    - (short term reflects expected path of FFR, long term reflects long-run equilibrium)
- yield curve (125,135 in Mishkin, (ch6))
    - Relate to QE? (337, 358, 569 in Mishkin (ch14,15,569))
- bond spreads against treasuries?
- inflation expectations: breakeven inflation rates (compare nominal vs real, have students compare calculation to published rate?) (Not sure if Mishkin discusses.)

output gap vs unemployment rate (Okun's law)

Real interst rate vs durable consumption, etc.

Tightening Cycles (See Mishkin ch 25 problems for examples, or Terry's suggestion:)
- Plot cycle comparison: manually set dates for tightening cycle starts and plot increase from baseline.
    - Overlay time series with different start points (graph of increase from low point vs months since first rate hike)
- do likewise for easing cycles
- plot unemployment rate during easing cycles
    - (good observation from Terry: we'll see FFR falling when UR is high because former is response to latter)


How tight is monetary policy (Terry's suggestions):
- "Many analysts look at the median long-run federal funds rate projection from the SEP as a measure of a neutral policy stance."
- [HLW model estimates from fed](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar) - compare to SEP rates.
- (My idea: redo Taylor rule with these rates?... ehh)
